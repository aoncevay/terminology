        "2025 modified AGI limits. You can find information about the 2025 contribution and modified AGI limits in Pub. 590-A. Tax law changes for 2025. When you figure how much income tax you want withheld from your pay and when you figure your estimated tax, consider tax law changes effective in 2025. For more information, see Pub. 505. Alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount increased. The AMT exemption amount is increased to $85,700 ($133,300 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse; $66,650 if married filing separately). The income levels at which the AMT exemption begins to phase out have increased to $609,350 ($1,218,700 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse). New reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP) changed the reporting requirements for third-party settlement organizations. Beginning in 2024, there are lower reporting thresholds for Form 1099-K. See chapter 8, later. Updated reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. For 2024, payment card companies, payment apps, and online marketplaces will be required to send you a Form 1099-K when the amount of your business transactions during the year is more than $5,000. In calendar year 2025, the threshold will lower to more than $2,500; and for 2026 and later years, the threshold will be more than $600. Changes to reporting amounts from Form 1099-K. Beginning in 2024, if you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error or for personal items sold at a loss, you will now enter these amounts in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1 (Form 1040).",

The publication goes on to explain the standard deduction, the kinds of expenses you may be able to deduct, and the various kinds of credits you may be able to take to reduce your tax. Throughout this publication are examples showing how the tax law applies in typical situations. Also throughout this publication are flowcharts and tables that present tax information in an easy-to-understand manner. Many of the subjects discussed in this publication are discussed in greater detail in other IRS publications. References to those other publications are provided for your information.",

        "The four chapters in this part provide basic information on the tax system. They take you through the first steps of filling out a tax return. They also provide information about dependents, and discuss recordkeeping requirements, IRS e-file (electronic filing), certain penalties, and the two methods used to pay tax during the year: withholding and estimated tax. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; and Schedule 3, Part II, Other Payments and Refundable Credits.",

They explain which income is and isn\u2019t taxed and discuss some of the adjustments to income that you can make in figuring your adjusted gross income. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; Schedule 2, Part II, Other Taxes; and Schedule 3, Part II, Other Payments and Refundable Credits.",
        "After you have figured your adjusted gross income, you are ready to subtract the deductions used to figure taxable income. You can subtract either the standard deduction or itemized deductions, and, if you qualify, the qualified business income deduction. Itemized deductions are deductions for certain expenses that are listed on Schedule A (Form 1040). The three chapters in this part discuss the standard deduction and certain itemized deductions. See chapter 10 for the factors to consider when deciding whether to take the standard deduction or itemized deductions. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; Schedule 2, Part II, Other Taxes; and Schedule 3, Part I, Nonrefundable Credits.",

The inquiry or examination may or may not result in more tax. We may close your case without change; or, you may receive a refund. The process of selecting a return for examination usually begins in one of two ways. First, we use computer programs to identify returns that may have incorrect amounts. These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2, on studies of past examinations, or on certain issues identified by compliance projects. Second, we use information from outside sources that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination. Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, explains the rules and procedures that we follow in examinations. The following sections give an overview of how we conduct examinations.",
        "If you do not agree with the examiner's proposed changes, you can appeal them to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. Most differences can be settled without expensive and time-consuming court trials. Your appeal rights are explained in detail in both Pub. 5, Your Appeal Rights and How to Prepare a Protest if You Don't Agree, and Pub. 556. If you do not wish to use the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or disagree with its findings, you may be able to take your case to the U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or the U.S. District Court where you live. If you take your case to court, the IRS will have the burden of proving certain facts if you kept adequate records to show your tax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and meet certain other conditions. If the court agrees with you on most issues in your case and finds that our position was largely unjustified, you may be able to recover some of your administrative and litigation costs. You will not be eligible to recover these costs unless you tried to resolve your case administratively, including going through the appeals system, and you gave us the information necessary to resolve the case.",

If we do contact other persons, such as a neighbor, a bank, an employer, or employees, we will generally need to tell them limited information, such as your name. The law prohibits us from disclosing any more information than is necessary to obtain or verify the information we are seeking.

        "This publication provides general information about the federal tax laws that apply to you if you are a self-employed person or a statutory employee. This publication has information on business income, expenses, and tax credits that may help you, as a small business owner, file your income tax return.",
        "You are a self-employed person if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or an independent contractor. You do not have to carry on regular full-time business activities to be self-employed. Having a part-time business in addition to your regular job or business may be self-employment.. Trade or business. A trade or business is generally an activity carried on to make a profit. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether or not an activity is a trade or business. You do not need to actually make a profit to be in a trade or business as long as you have a profit motive. You do need to make ongoing efforts to further the interests of your business. Limited liability company (LLC). An LLC is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization. Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done.

If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship or a partnership.

If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership for the tax year. Making this election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065 but still give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based. For an explanation of \"material participation,\" see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. Only businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a QJV.. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture.

These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2; on studies of past examinations; or on certain issues identified by other special projects. Another way is to use information from compliance projects that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination.

An exception to the charge-off rule exists for debt that has been significantly modified and on which the holder recognized gain. For more information, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3) Deduction disallowed. Generally, you can claim a partial bad debt deduction only in the year you make the charge-off on your books. If, under audit, the IRS doesn\u2019t allow your deduction and the debt becomes partly worthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the amount you charged off in that year plus the disallowed amount charged off in the earlier year. The charge-off in the earlier year, unless reversed on your books, fulfills the charge-off requirement for the later year.",
        "If a debt becomes totally worthless in the current tax year, you can deduct the entire amount minus any amount deducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was only partly worthless. You don\u2019t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don\u2019t and the IRS later rules the debt is only partly worthless, you will not be allowed a deduction for the debt in that tax year because a deduction of a partly worthless bad debt is limited to the amount actually charged off. See Partly worthless debts , earlier.",

However, if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident and is entitled to the joint tax rates as a surviving spouse, the choice will not end until the close of the last year for which these joint rates may be used. If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice ends on the first day after the close of the tax year in which the spouses died. 3. Legal separation. A legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance ends the choice as of the beginning of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs. 4. Inadequate records.

For this purpose, \u201cU.S. depreciation adjustments\u201d are the depreciation adjustments to the basis of the property that are allowable in figuring taxable income from U.S. sources. However, if the property is used predominantly in the United States during a tax year, all depreciation deductions allowable for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. But there are some exceptions for certain transportation, communications, and other property used internationally. Gain from the sale of depreciable property that is more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property is sourced as if the property were inventory property, as discussed above. A loss is sourced in the same way as the depreciation deductions were sourced. However, if the property was used predominantly in the United States, the entire loss reduces U.S. source income. The basis of property usually means the cost (money plus the fair market value of other property or services) of property you acquire. Depreciation is an amount deducted to recover the cost or other basis of a trade or business asset. The amount you can deduct depends on the property's cost, when you began using the property, how long it will take to recover your cost, and which depreciation method you use. A depreciation deduction is any deduction for depreciation or amortization or any other allowable deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense.",
        "Intangible property includes patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other like property. The gain from the sale of amortizable or depreciable intangible property, up to the previously allowable amortization or depreciation deductions, is sourced in the same way as the original deductions were sourced. This is the same as the source rule for gain from the sale of depreciable property. See Depreciable property, earlier, for details on how to apply this rule. Gain in excess of the amortization or depreciation deductions is sourced in the country where the property is used if the income from the sale is contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of that property. If the income is not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the income is sourced according to your tax home (discussed earlier). If payments for goodwill do not depend on its productivity, use, or disposition, their source is the country in which the goodwill was generated.",
        "Despite any of the earlier rules, if you do not have a tax home in the United States, but you maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, treat the income from any sale of personal property (including inventory property) that is attributable to that office or place of business as U.S. source income. However, this rule does not apply to sales of inventory property for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if your office or other fixed place of business outside the United States materially participated in the sale. If you have a tax home in the United States but maintain an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States, income from sales of personal property, other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangibles, that is attributable to that foreign office or place of business may be treated as U.S. source income. The income is treated as U.S. source income if an income tax of less than 10% of the income from the sale is paid to a foreign country. This rule also applies to losses if the foreign country would have imposed an income tax of less than 10% had the sale resulted in a gain.",
        "The place or manner of payment is immaterial in determining the source of the income. A substitute interest payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as the interest on the transferred security.",
        "U.S. source interest income does not include the following items. 1. Interest paid by a resident alien or a domestic corporation on obligations issued before August 10, 2010, if for the 3-year period ending with the close of the payer's tax year preceding the interest payment, at least 80% (0.80) of the payer's total gross income: 1. Is from sources outside the United States, and 2. Is attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business by the individual or corporation in a foreign country or a U.S. territory. However, the interest will be considered U.S. source interest income if either of the following applies. 1. The recipient of the interest is related to the resident alien or domestic corporation. See section 954(d)(3) for the definition of \u201crelated person.\u201d 2. The terms of the obligation are significantly modified after August 9, 2010. Any extension of the term of the obligation is considered a significant modification. 2. Interest paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership on deposits or withdrawable accounts with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under federal or state law if the interest paid or credited can be deducted by the association. 3. Interest on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, but only if the branch is in the commercial banking business.",
        "In most cases, dividend income received from domestic corporations is U.S. source income. Dividend income from foreign corporations is usually foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed later. A substitute dividend payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as a distribution on the transferred security.",
        "A payment of a dividend equivalent amount includes any gross amount that references a U.S. source dividend and that is used to compute any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under a contract, if the taxpayer is the long party under the contract. As a result, a taxpayer may be treated as having received a dividend equivalent payment even if the taxpayer makes a net payment or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero. In 2024, an NPC or ELI will generally be a specified NPC or specified ELI, respectively, if the contract is a delta one transaction. Generally, delta is the ratio of change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the stock referenced by the contract. Generally, the amount of a dividend equivalent for a specified NPC or specified ELI is the per share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares of stock referenced by the contract multiplied by the delta of the contract. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Regulations section 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or its successors) for additional information.",
        "All wages and any other compensation for services performed in the United States are considered to be from sources in the United States. The only exceptions to this rule are discussed under Employees of foreign persons, organizations, or offices, later, and under Crew members, earlier. If you are an employee and receive compensation for labor or personal services performed both inside and outside the United States, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (other than certain fringe benefits) is sourced on a time basis. Certain fringe benefits (such as housing and education) are sourced on a geographical basis. Or, you may be permitted to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See Alternative Basis, later.",
        "Certain companies selling products through a multilevel marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor, who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, are entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multilevel marketing companies to independent (nonemployee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor are performed and may, depending on the facts, be considered multiyear compensation, with the source of income determined over the period to which such compensation is attributable.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of compensation for labor or personal services from self-employment on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of your particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will call for an apportionment on a time basis, as explained next.",
        "The source of multiyear compensation is generally determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation is attributable. Multiyear compensation is compensation that is included in your income in 1 tax year but that is attributable to a period that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period to which the compensation is attributable based on the facts and circumstances of your case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entire multiyear period. The amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multiyear compensation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in connection with the project.",
        "The above fringe benefits, except for tax reimbursement and hazardous or hardship duty pay, are sourced based on your principal place of work. Your principal place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This could be your office, plant, store, shop, or other location. If there is no one place where you spend most of your working time, your main job location is the place where your work is centered, such as where you report for work or are otherwise required to \u201cbase\u201d your work. If you have more than one job at any time, your main job location depends on the facts in each case. The most important factors to be considered are: The total time you spend at each place, The amount of work you do at each place, and How much money you earn at each place.",
        "The source of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of your dependents is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. An education fringe benefit includes payments only for the following expenses for education at an elementary or secondary school. Tuition, fees, academic tutoring, special needs services for a special needs student, books, supplies, and other equipment. Room and board and uniforms that are required or provided by the school in connection with enrollment or attendance.",
        "The source of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. Your local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that you receive as compensation for local transportation for you or your spouse or dependents at the location of your principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any employer-provided vehicle used predominantly by you, your spouse, or your dependents for local transportation. Actual expenses do not include the cost (including interest) of any vehicle purchased by you or on your behalf.",
        "The source of a moving expense reimbursement is generally based on the location of your new principal place of work. However, the source is determined based on the location of your former principal place of work if you provide sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of your case. Sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for moving expenses that you incur to return to your former principal place of work regardless of whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, your return move to your former principal place of work.",
        "If you are an employee, you can determine the source of your compensation under an alternative basis if you establish to the satisfaction of the IRS that, under the facts and circumstances of your case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation than the time or geographical basis. If you use an alternative basis, you must keep (and have available for inspection) records to document why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation. Also, if your total compensation from all sources is $250,000 or more, check \u201cYes\u201d to both questions on line K of Schedule OI (Form 1040-NR), and attach a written statement to your tax return that sets forth all of the following. 1. Your name and SSN (entered across the top of the statement). 2. The specific compensation income, or the specific fringe benefit, for which you are using the alternative basis. 3. For each item in (2), the alternative basis of allocation of source used. 4. For each item in (2), a computation showing how the alternative allocation was computed. 5. A comparison of the dollar amount of the U.S. compensation and foreign compensation sourced under both the alternative basis and the time or geographical basis, discussed earlier.",

This is true whether the vessel or aircraft is owned, hired, or leased. The term \u201cvessel or aircraft\u201d includes any container used in connection with a vessel or aircraft. All income from transportation that begins and ends in the United States is treated as derived from sources in the United States. If the transportation begins or ends in the United States, 50% of the transportation income is treated as derived from sources in the United States. For transportation income from personal services, 50% of the income is U.S. source income if the transportation is between the United States and a U.S. territory. For nonresident aliens, this only applies to income derived from, or in connection with, an aircraft. For information on how U.S. source transportation income is taxed, see chapter 4.",

However, see Activities to be performed outside the United States, later. For example, payments for research or study in the United States made by the United States, a noncorporate U.S. resident, or a domestic corporation are from U.S. sources. Similar payments from a foreign government or foreign corporation are foreign source payments even though the funds may be disbursed through a U.S. agent. Payments made by an entity designated as a public international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act are from foreign sources.",

That part is the amount attributable to earnings of the pension plan and the employer contributions made for services performed in the United States. This applies whether the distribution is made under a qualified or nonqualified stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan (whether or not funded). If you performed services as an employee of the United States, you may receive a distribution from the U.S. Government under a plan, such as the Civil Service Retirement System, that is treated as a qualified pension plan.

For a discussion of these rules, see Foreign Income, later.",
        "Use the two tests described below to determine whether an item of U.S. source income falling in one of the three categories above and received during the tax year is effectively connected with your U.S. trade or business. If the tests indicate that the item of income is effectively connected, you must include it with your other effectively connected income. If the item of income is not effectively connected, include it with all other income discussed under The 30% Tax, later, in this chapter.",
        "Generally, stock of a corporation is not treated as an asset used in, or held for use in, a trade or business in the United States.",
        "Under this test, if the conduct of the U.S. trade or business was a material factor in producing the income, the income is considered effectively connected.",
        "You are usually engaged in a U.S. trade or business when you perform personal services in the United States. Personal services income you receive in a tax year in which you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Income received in a year other than the year you performed the services is also effectively connected if it would have been effectively connected if received in the year you performed the services. Personal services income includes wages, salaries, commissions, fees, per diem allowances, and employee allowances and bonuses. The income may be paid to you in the form of cash, services, or property. If you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business only because you perform personal services in the United States during the tax year, income and gains from assets, and gains and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are generally not effectively connected with your trade or business. However, if there is a direct economic relationship between your holding of the asset and your trade or business of performing personal services, the income, gain, or loss is effectively connected.",
        "If you performed personal services in the United States after 1986, and in a later tax year, you receive pension or retirement distributions attributable to these services when you are a nonresident alien, such distributions are effectively connected income to the extent attributable to contributions. This is true whether or not you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business in the year you receive the pension or retirement distributions.",
        "\u201cFixed place of business\u201d generally means a place, site, structure, or other similar facility through which you engage in a trade or business. \u201cRegularly scheduled transportation\u201d means that a ship or aircraft follows a published schedule with repeated sailings or flights at regular intervals between the same points for voyages or flights that begin or end in the United States. This definition applies to both scheduled and chartered air transportation. If you do not meet the two conditions above, the income is not effectively connected and is taxed at a 4% rate. See Transportation Tax, later in this chapter.",
        "All profits or losses from U.S. sources that are from the operation of a business in the United States are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. For example, profit from the sale in the United States of inventory property purchased either in this country or in a foreign country is effectively connected trade or business income. A share of U.S. source profits or losses of a partnership that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States is also effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States.",
        "Gains and losses from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests (whether or not they are capital assets) are taxed as if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. You must treat the gain or loss as effectively connected with that trade or business.",
        "This is any interest in real property located in the United States or the U.S. Virgin Islands or any interest (other than as a creditor) in a domestic corporation that is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Real property includes the following. 1. Land and unsevered natural products of the land, such as growing crops and timber, and mines, wells, and other natural deposits. 2. Improvements on land, including buildings, other permanent structures, and their structural components. 3. Personal property associated with the use of real property, such as equipment used in farming, mining, forestry, or construction or property used in lodging facilities or rented office space, unless the personal property is: 1. Disposed of more than 1 year before or after the disposition of the real property, or 2. Separately sold to persons unrelated either to the seller or to the buyer of the real property.",

An interest in a foreign corporation owning U.S. real property is generally not a U.S. real property interest unless the corporation chooses to be treated as a domestic corporation.",
        "In most cases, any distribution from a QIE to a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or other QIE that is attributable to the QIE\u2019s gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is treated as gain recognized by the nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or other QIE from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest. Certain exceptions apply to the look-through rule for distributions by QIEs. A distribution by a QIE with respect to stock regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States is not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder owns 5% or less of that stock (or 10% or less of that stock in the case of a REIT) at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution. A distribution made by a REIT is generally not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder is a qualified shareholder (as described in section 897(k)(3)). A distribution that you do not treat as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest may be included in your gross income as a regular dividend.",
        "Dispositions of stock in a REIT that is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a qualified shareholder will not be treated as a U.S. real property interest. See sections 897(k)(2) through (4) for more information.",
        "For the purpose of determining whether a QIE is domestically controlled, the following rules apply. 1. A person holding less than 5% of any class of stock of the QIE, which is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States at all times during the testing period, would be treated as a U.S. person unless the QIE has actual knowledge that such person is not a U.S. person. 2. Any stock in a QIE that is held by another QIE will be treated as held by a foreign person if: 1. Any class of stock of such other QIE is regularly traded on an established securities market, or 2. Such other QIE is a RIC that issues certain redeemable securities. Notwithstanding the above, the stock of the QIE will be treated as held by a U.S. person if such other QIE is domestically controlled. 3. Stock in a QIE held by any other QIE not described above will be treated as held by a U.S. person in proportion to the stock of such other QIE that is (or is treated as) held by a U.S. person.",
        "If this occurs, you are treated as having a gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest in an amount equal to the distribution that would have been treated as such gain. This also applies to any substitute dividend payment. A transaction is not treated as an applicable wash sale transaction if: You actually receive the distribution from the domestically controlled QIE related to the interest disposed of, or acquired, in the transaction; or You dispose of any class of stock in a QIE that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States but only if you did not own more than 5% of that class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution.",
        "Any foreign source income that is equivalent to any item of income described above is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. For example, foreign source interest and dividend equivalents are treated as U.S. effectively connected income if the income is derived by a foreign person in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business within the United States.",
        "Income you receive during the tax year that is effectively connected with your trade or business in the United States is, after allowable deductions, taxed at the rates that apply to U.S. citizens and residents. Generally, you can receive effectively connected income only if you are a nonresident alien engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year. However, if you receive payments from the sale or exchange of property, the performance of services, or any other transaction during a tax year in which you are not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, but such payments would have been treated as effectively connected income in the year the transaction took place or you performed the services, then they are treated as effectively connected income in the tax year you received them.",

        "Tax at a 30% (or lower treaty) rate applies to certain items of income or gains from U.S. sources but only if the items are not effectively connected with your U.S. trade or business.",
        "The 30% (or lower treaty) rate applies to the gross amount of U.S. source fixed, determinable, annual, or periodical (FDAP) gains, profits, or income. Income is fixed when it is paid in amounts known ahead of time. Income is determinable whenever there is a basis for figuring the amount to be paid. Income can be periodic if it is paid from time to time. It does not have to be paid annually or at regular intervals. Income can be determinable or periodic even if the length of time during which the payments are made is increased or decreased. Items specifically included as fixed or determinable income are interest (other than OID), dividends, dividend equivalent payments (defined in chapter 2), rents, premiums, annuities, salaries, wages, and other compensation. A substitute dividend or interest payment received under a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is treated the same as the amounts received on the transferred security. Other items of income, such as royalties, may also be subject to the 30% tax. Some fixed or determinable income may be exempt from U.S. tax. Seechapter 3 if you are not sure whether the income is taxable..",
        "In general, nonresident aliens are subject to the 30% tax on the gross proceeds from gambling won in the United States if that income is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and is not exempted by treaty. However, no tax is imposed on nonbusiness gambling income a nonresident alien wins playing blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, or big-6 wheel in the United States. Nonresident aliens are taxed at graduated rates on net gambling income won in the United States that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. This income is exempt under some tax treaties. See Table 1 in the Tax Treaty Tables, available at IRS.gov/TreatyTables, for a list of tax treaties that exempt gambling winnings from U.S. tax.

The choice applies to all income from real property located in the United States and held for the production of income and to all income from any interest in such property. This includes income from rents, royalties from mines, oil or gas wells, or other natural resources. It also includes gains from the sale or exchange of timber, coal, or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest. You can make this choice only for real property income that is not otherwise effectively connected with your U.S. trade or business. If you make the choice, you can claim deductions attributable to the real property income and only your net income from real property is taxed.

        "This chapter discusses how to pay your U.S. income tax as you earn or receive income during the year. In general, the federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. There are two ways to pay as you go. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your pay. Tax may also be withheld from certain other income\u2014including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling winnings. In each case, the amount withheld is paid to the U.S. Treasury in your name. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. People who are in business for themselves will generally have to pay their tax this way. You may have to pay estimated tax if you receive income such as dividends, interest, rent, and royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax as well.",

If you are a resident alien and you receive income other than wages (such as dividends and royalties) from sources within the United States, file Form W-9 or similar statement with the withholding agent (generally, the payer of the income) so the agent will not withhold tax on the income at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you receive this type of income as a nonresident alien, file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent so that the agent will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate.

You may be able to provide certain information to the transferee to reduce or eliminate withholding. For example, if a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies to all of the gain realized on a transfer, the transferee does not need to withhold if you provide a notice describing the application of a nonrecognition provision. If you are a transferee that failed to withhold, under section 1446(f)(4), the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to you an amount equal to the tax you failed to withhold (plus interest, if applicable). On November 30, 2020, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued final regulations under section 1446(f) in T.D. 9926 (85 FR 76910) for transfers of both non-PTP and PTP interests. The final regulations require any transferee to withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest (other than certain PTP interests) under section 1446(f)(1), unless an exception to withholding applies. These regulations generally apply to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021. However, in accordance with Notice 2021-51, 2021-36 I.R.B. 361, the rules related to withholding under section 1446(f)(4) and to transfers of PTP interests apply to transfers occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, the final regulations revised certain provisions in Regulations section 1.1446-4 for withholding under section 1446(a) on PTP distributions. Also in accordance with Notice 2021-51, these revisions apply to PTP distributions made on or after January 1, 2023. Notices 2018-8 and 2018-29 apply to transfers that occur before the effective date of the final regulations or, as previously described, taxpayers may apply the proposed regulations to transfers of non-PTP interests during this time.

Your payments of these taxes contribute to your coverage under the U.S. social security system. Social security coverage provides retirement benefits, survivors and disability benefits, and medical insurance (Medicare) benefits to individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. In most cases, the first $168,600 of taxable wages received in 2024 for services performed in the United States is subject to social security tax. All taxable wages are subject to Medicare tax. Your employer deducts these taxes from each wage payment. Your employer must deduct these taxes even if you do not expect to qualify for social security or Medicare benefits. You can claim a credit for excess social security tax on your income tax return if you have more than one employer and the amount deducted from your combined wages for 2024 is more than $10,453.20.

To get help any time with general tax topics, visit www.TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov. The site can help you with common tax issues and situations, such as what to do if you make a mistake on your return or if you get a notice from the IRS. TAS works to resolve large-scale (systemic) problems that affect many taxpayers. You can report systemic issues at www.IRS.gov/SAMS. (Be sure not to include any personal identifiable information.)",

        "You can\u2019t deduct as a theft loss the decline in market value of stock acquired on the open market for investment if the decline is caused by disclosure of accounting fraud or other illegal misconduct by the officers or directors of the corporation that issued the stock. However, you may be able to deduct it as a capital loss on Schedule D (Form 1040) if the stock is sold or exchanged or becomes completely worthless. For more information about stock sales, worthless stock, and capital losses, see chapter 4 of Pub. 550.",
        "You can choose to deduct a loss on deposits as a casualty loss for any year in which you can reasonably estimate how much of your deposits you have lost in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution. The choice is generally made on the return you file for that year and applies to all your losses on deposits for the year in that particular financial institution. If you treat the loss as a casualty loss, you can\u2019t treat the same amount of the loss as a nonbusiness bad debt when it actually becomes worthless. However, you can take a nonbusiness bad debt deduction for any amount of loss that is more than the estimated amount you deducted as a casualty or ordinary loss. Once you make the choice, you can\u2019t change it without permission from the IRS.",

You don\u2019t have a casualty or theft loss to the extent you are reimbursed. If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, the loss isn\u2019t sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be received. If you expect to be reimbursed for part or all of your loss, you must subtract the expected reimbursement when you figure your loss.

If you don\u2019t file an insurance claim, you can\u2019t deduct the full unrecovered amount as a casualty or theft loss and only the part of the loss that isn\u2019t covered by your insurance policy is deductible. The portion of the loss usually not covered by insurance (for example, a deductible) isn\u2019t subject to this rule.",

One way is to deduct the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold by properly reporting your opening and closing inventories. Don\u2019t claim this loss again as a casualty or theft loss. If you take the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold, include any insurance or other reimbursement you receive for the loss in gross income. The other way is to deduct the loss separately. If you deduct it separately, eliminate the affected inventory items from the cost of goods sold by making a downward adjustment to opening inventory or purchases. Reduce the loss by the reimbursement you received. Don\u2019t include the reimbursement in gross income.

If you recovered property after you had already taken a theft loss deduction, you must refigure your loss using the smaller of the property\u2019s adjusted basis (explained later) or the decrease in FMV from the time just before it was stolen until the time it was recovered. Use this amount to refigure your total loss for the year in which the loss was deducted. If your refigured loss is less than the loss you deducted, you generally have to report the difference as income in the recovery year.

But you can use the cost of cleaning up or of making repairs after a casualty as a measure of the decrease in FMV if you meet all the following conditions. The repairs are actually made. The repairs are necessary to bring the property back to its condition before the casualty. The amount spent for repairs isn\u2019t excessive. The repairs take care of the damage only. The value of the property after the repairs isn\u2019t, due to the repairs, more than the value of the property before the casualty.",
        "The cost of restoring landscaping to its original condition after a casualty may indicate the decrease in FMV. You may be able to measure your loss by what you spend on the following.

Under the contractor safe harbor method, you may use the contract price for the repairs specified in a contract prepared by an independent and licensed contractor to determine the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property. This safe harbor method doesn\u2019t apply unless you are subject to a binding contract signed by you and the contractor setting forth the itemized costs to restore your personal-use residential real property to its condition immediately before the casualty.",
        "Under the disaster loan appraisal safe harbor method, you may use an appraisal prepared to obtain a loan of federal funds or a loan guarantee from the federal government that identifies your estimated loss from a federally declared disaster to determine the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property.",

The amount you spend on insurance or to board up your house against a storm isn\u2019t part of your loss. If the property is business property, these expenses are deductible as business expenses. If you make permanent improvements to your property to protect it against a casualty or theft, add the cost of these improvements to your basis in the property. An example would be the cost of a dike to prevent flooding.",

        "Photographs taken after a casualty will be helpful in establishing the condition and value of the property after it was damaged. Photographs showing the condition of the property after it was repaired, restored, or replaced may also be helpful. Appraisals are used to figure the decrease in FMV because of a casualty or theft. See Appraisal, earlier, under Figuring Decrease in FMV\u2014Items To Consider for information about appraisals. The costs of photographs and appraisals used as evidence of the value and condition of property damaged as a result of a casualty aren\u2019t a part of the loss.

You must figure each loss separately because the losses attributed to these two uses are figured in two different ways. When figuring each loss, allocate the total cost or basis, the FMV before and after the casualty or theft loss, and the insurance or other reimbursement between the business and personal use of the property. The $100 rule and the 10% rule apply only to the casualty or theft loss on the personal-use portion of the property.",

You may be able to exclude up to $250,000 of the gain (up to $500,000 if married filing jointly). To exclude a gain, you must generally have owned and lived in the property as your main home for at least 2 years during the 5-year period ending on the date it was destroyed.

You must ordinarily report the gain on your stolen or destroyed property if you receive money or unlike property as reimbursement. However, you can choose to postpone reporting the gain if you purchase property that is similar or related in service or use to the stolen or destroyed property within a specified replacement period, discussed later. You can also choose to postpone reporting the gain if you purchase a controlling interest (at least 80%) in a corporation owning property that is similar or related in service or use to the property. See Controlling interest in a corporation, later. If you have a gain on damaged property, you can postpone reporting the gain if you spend the reimbursement to restore the property.

If you spend the money you receive from the insurance company for other purposes, and borrow money to buy replacement property, you can still postpone reporting the gain if you meet the other requirements.",
        "If your gain from the reimbursement you receive because of the destruction of your main home is more than the amount you can exclude from your income (see Main home destroyed under Figuring a Gain, earlier), you can postpone reporting the excess gain by buying replacement property that is similar or related in service or use. To postpone reporting all the excess gain, the replacement property must cost at least as much as the amount you received because of the destruction minus the excluded gain. Also, if you postpone reporting any part of your gain under these rules, you are treated as having owned and used the replacement property as your main home for the period you owned and used the destroyed property as your main home.",
