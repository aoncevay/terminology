The inquiry or examination may or may not result in more tax. We may close your case without change; or, you may receive a refund. The process of selecting a return for examination usually begins in one of two ways. First, we use computer programs to identify returns that may have incorrect amounts. These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2, on studies of past examinations, or on certain issues identified by compliance projects. Second, we use information from outside sources that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination. Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, explains the rules and procedures that we follow in examinations. The following sections give an overview of how we conduct examinations.",

If you do not wish to use the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or disagree with its findings, you may be able to take your case to the U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or the U.S. District Court where you live. If you take your case to court, the IRS will have the burden of proving certain facts if you kept adequate records to show your tax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and meet certain other conditions. If the court agrees with you on most issues in your case and finds that our position was largely unjustified, you may be able to recover some of your administrative and litigation costs. You will not be eligible to recover these costs unless you tried to resolve your case administratively, including going through the appeals system, and you gave us the information necessary to resolve the case.",

        "You are a self-employed person if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or an independent contractor. You do not have to carry on regular full-time business activities to be self-employed. Having a part-time business in addition to your regular job or business may be self-employment.. Trade or business. A trade or business is generally an activity carried on to make a profit. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether or not an activity is a trade or business. You do not need to actually make a profit to be in a trade or business as long as you have a profit motive. You do need to make ongoing efforts to further the interests of your business. Limited liability company (LLC). An LLC is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization. Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax. For more information on determining whether you are an employee or independent contractor, see Pub. 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide.",

If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship or a partnership. States with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. A change in your reporting position will be treated as a conversion of the entity. See Pub. 555 for more information about community property laws. Exception—Qualified joint venture (QJV). If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership for the tax year. Making this election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065 but still give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based. For an explanation of \"material participation,\" see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. Only businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a QJV.. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. Each of you must file a separate Schedule C and a separate Schedule SE. For more information, see Qualified Joint Ventures in the Instructions for Schedule SE.",

Another way is to use information from compliance projects that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals.

For a taxpayer with an applicable financial statement or other financial statement as the Secretary may specify, the all-events test for an item of gross income is considered met no later than when taken into account in an applicable financial statement or such other financial statement.",

However, if you receive an advance payment, you can elect to postpone including the advance payment in income until the next tax year. You cannot postpone including any payment beyond that tax year. For more information, see Pub. 538 and section 451.",
        "Under an accrual method of accounting, you generally deduct or capitalize a business expense when both the following apply. 1. The all-events test has been met. The test has been met when: 1. All events have occurred that fix the fact of liability, and 2. The liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. 2. Economic performance has occurred.",
        "You generally cannot deduct or capitalize a business expense until economic performance occurs. If your expense is for property or services provided to you, or for your use of property, economic performance occurs as the property or services are provided or as the property is used. If your expense is for property or services you provide to others, economic performance occurs as you provide the property or services. An exception allows certain recurring items to be treated as incurred during a tax year even though economic performance has not occurred. For more information on economic performance, see Economic Performance under Accrual Method in Pub. 538.",

Determine the relationship, for this rule, as of the end of the tax year for which the expense or interest would otherwise be deductible. If a deduction is not allowed under this rule, the rule will continue to apply even if your relationship with the person ends before the expense or interest is includible in the gross income of that person. Related persons include members of your immediate family, including siblings (either whole or half), your spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. For a list of other related persons, see section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code.",
        "You can generally use any combination of cash, accrual, and special methods of accounting if the combination clearly shows your income and expenses and you use it consistently. However, the following restrictions apply. If an inventory is necessary to account for your income, you must generally use an accrual method for purchases and sales. (See, however, Inventories, later.) You can use the cash method for all other items of income and expenses. If you use the cash method for figuring your income, you must use the cash method for reporting your expenses. If you use an accrual method for reporting your expenses, you must use an accrual method for figuring your income. If you use a combination method that includes the cash method, treat that combination method as the cash method.",

If you choose not to keep an inventory, you won’t be treated as failing to clearly reflect income if your method of accounting for inventory treats inventory as non-incidental material or supplies, or conforms to your financial accounting treatment of inventories. If, however, you choose to keep an inventory, you must generally use an accrual method of accounting and value the inventory each year to determine your cost of goods sold in Part III of Schedule C.",

To determine the value of your inventory, you need a method for identifying the items in your inventory and a method for valuing these items. Inventory valuation rules cannot be the same for all kinds of businesses. The method you use to value your inventory must conform to generally accepted accounting principles for similar businesses and must clearly reflect income. Your inventory practices must be consistent from year to year.",
        "Under the uniform capitalization rules, you must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs for production or resale activities. Include these costs in the basis of property you produce or acquire for resale, rather than claiming them as a current deduction.

        "The sale of a business is usually not a sale of one asset. Instead, all the assets of the business are sold. Generally, when this occurs, each asset is treated as being sold separately for determining the treatment of gain or loss. Both the buyer and seller involved in the sale of a business must report to the IRS the allocation of the sales price among the business assets. Use Form 8594 , Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060, to provide this information. The buyer and seller should each attach Form 8594 to their federal income tax return for the year in which the sale occurred. For more information about the sale of a business, see Pub. 544.",
        "The adjusted basis of property generally is your original cost or other basis plus certain additions, and minus certain deductions such as depreciation and casualty losses. In determining gain or loss, the costs of transferring property to a new owner, such as selling expenses, are added to the adjusted basis of the property.",
        "Your gain or loss realized from a disposition of property is usually a recognized gain or loss for tax purposes. Recognized gains must be included in gross income. Recognized losses are deductible from gross income. However, a gain or loss realized from certain exchanges of property is not recognized. See Nontaxable exchanges, earlier. Also, you cannot deduct a loss from the disposition of property held for personal use.",
        "You must classify your gains and losses as either ordinary or capital gains or losses. You must do this to figure your net capital gain or loss. Generally, you will have a capital gain or loss if you dispose of a capital asset. For the most part, everything you own and use for personal purposes or investment is a capital asset. Certain property you use in your business is not a capital asset. A gain or loss from a disposition of this property is an ordinary gain or loss. However, if you held the property longer than 1 year, you may be able to treat the gain or loss as a capital gain or loss. These gains and losses are called section 1231 gains and losses. For more information about ordinary and capital gains and losses, see chapters 2 and 3 of Pub. 544.",
        "If you have a capital gain or loss, you must determine whether it is long term or short term. Whether a gain or loss is long or short term depends on how long you own the property before you dispose of it. The time you own property before disposing of it is called the holding period.",

A connection exists if it is clear that the payment of income would not have been made if you did not have the business. You can have business income even if you are not involved in the activity on a regular full-time basis. Income from work you do on the side in addition to your regular job can be business income. For example, you may be in the business of providing services for a ride-sharing business as a second job.

You are generally considered to provide substantial services for tenants if they are primarily for the tenants' convenience and are not normally provided to maintain the lots in a condition for occupancy. Services are substantial if the compensation for the services makes up a material part of the tenants' rental payments. Examples of services that are not normally provided for the tenants' convenience include supervising and maintaining a recreational hall provided by the park, distributing a monthly newsletter to tenants, operating a laundry facility, and helping tenants buy or sell their trailers.

You received payments after your agreement to perform services for the company ended. You did not perform any services for the company after your service agreement ended and before the end of the year in which you received the payment. You entered into a covenant not to compete against the company for at least a 1-year period beginning on the date your service agreement ended. The amount of the payments depended primarily on policies sold by you or credited to your account during the last year of your service agreement or the extent to which those policies remain in force for some period after your service agreement ended, or both. The amount of the payment did not depend to any extent on length of service or overall earnings from services performed for the company (regardless of whether eligibility for the payments depended on length of service).",

The basis of donated inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold. If the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year. A special rule may apply to certain donations of food inventory.

The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price. Next, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.",

The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on your income statement are $300,000. Your cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 − $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, you divide gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000).

You don’t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don’t and the IRS later rules the debt is only partly worthless, you will not be allowed a deduction for the debt in that tax year because a deduction of a partly worthless bad debt is limited to the amount actually charged off.

You must, however, file all income tax returns that have not yet been filed as required, and pay all income tax that is due on these returns. Your Form 1040-C must include all income received, and reasonably expected to be received, during the entire year of departure.

If the choice is ended in one of the following ways, neither spouse can make this choice in any later tax year. 1. Revocation. Either spouse can revoke the choice for any tax year, provided they make the revocation by the due date for filing the tax return for that tax year. The spouse who revokes the choice must attach a signed statement declaring that the choice is being revoked. The statement must include the name, address, and TIN of each spouse.

The statement must also include a list of any states, foreign countries, and territories that have community property laws in which either spouse is domiciled or where real property is located from which either spouse receives income. File the statement as follows. 1. If the spouse revoking the choice must file a return, attach the statement to the return for the first year the revocation applies. 2. If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return, but does file a return (for example, to obtain a refund), attach the statement to the return. 3. If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return and does not file a claim for refund, send the statement to the Internal Revenue Service Center where you filed the last joint return. 2. Death. The death of either spouse ends the choice, beginning with the first tax year following the year the spouse died. However, if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident and is entitled to the joint tax rates as a surviving spouse, the choice will not end until the close of the last year for which these joint rates may be used. If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice ends on the first day after the close of the tax year in which the spouses died. 3. Legal separation. A legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance ends the choice as of the beginning of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs. 4. Inadequate records.

For information on determining that part, see Regulations section 1.863-1(b).",
        "Personal property is property, such as machinery, equipment, or furniture, that is not real property. Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally has its source in the United States if you have a tax home in the United States.

        "Inventory property is personal property that is stock in trade or that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of your trade or business. Income from the sale of inventory that you purchased is sourced where the property is sold. Generally, this is where title to the property passes to the buyer. For example, income from the sale of inventory in the United States is U.S. source income, whether you purchased it in the United States or in a foreign country. Income from the sale of inventory property that you produced in the United States and sold outside the United States (or vice versa) is sourced where the property is produced. These rules apply even if your tax home is not in the United States.",
        "To determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first figure the part of the gain that is not more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property. You allocate this part of the gain to sources in the United States based on the ratio of U.S. depreciation adjustments to total depreciation adjustments. The rest of this part of the gain is considered to be from sources outside the United States. For this purpose, “U.S. depreciation adjustments” are the depreciation adjustments to the basis of the property that are allowable in figuring taxable income from U.S. sources. However, if the property is used predominantly in the United States during a tax year, all depreciation deductions allowable for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. But there are some exceptions for certain transportation, communications, and other property used internationally. Gain from the sale of depreciable property that is more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property is sourced as if the property were inventory property, as discussed above. A loss is sourced in the same way as the depreciation deductions were sourced. However, if the property was used predominantly in the United States, the entire loss reduces U.S. source income. The basis of property usually means the cost (money plus the fair market value of other property or services) of property you acquire. Depreciation is an amount deducted to recover the cost or other basis of a trade or business asset. The amount you can deduct depends on the property's cost, when you began using the property, how long it will take to recover your cost, and which depreciation method you use. A depreciation deduction is any deduction for depreciation or amortization or any other allowable deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense.",
        "Intangible property includes patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other like property. The gain from the sale of amortizable or depreciable intangible property, up to the previously allowable amortization or depreciation deductions, is sourced in the same way as the original deductions were sourced. This is the same as the source rule for gain from the sale of depreciable property. See Depreciable property, earlier, for details on how to apply this rule. Gain in excess of the amortization or depreciation deductions is sourced in the country where the property is used if the income from the sale is contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of that property. If the income is not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the income is sourced according to your tax home (discussed earlier). If payments for goodwill do not depend on its productivity, use, or disposition, their source is the country in which the goodwill was generated.",
        "Despite any of the earlier rules, if you do not have a tax home in the United States, but you maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, treat the income from any sale of personal property (including inventory property) that is attributable to that office or place of business as U.S. source income. However, this rule does not apply to sales of inventory property for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if your office or other fixed place of business outside the United States materially participated in the sale. If you have a tax home in the United States but maintain an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States, income from sales of personal property, other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangibles, that is attributable to that foreign office or place of business may be treated as U.S. source income. The income is treated as U.S. source income if an income tax of less than 10% of the income from the sale is paid to a foreign country. This rule also applies to losses if the foreign country would have imposed an income tax of less than 10% had the sale resulted in a gain.",
        "The place or manner of payment is immaterial in determining the source of the income. A substitute interest payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as the interest on the transferred security.",

Interest paid by a resident alien or a domestic corporation on obligations issued before August 10, 2010, if for the 3-year period ending with the close of the payer's tax year preceding the interest payment, at least 80% (0.80) of the payer's total gross income: 1. Is from sources outside the United States, and 2. Is attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business by the individual or corporation in a foreign country or a U.S. territory. However, the interest will be considered U.S. source interest income if either of the following applies. 1. The recipient of the interest is related to the resident alien or domestic corporation. See section 954(d)(3) for the definition of “related person.” 2. The terms of the obligation are significantly modified after August 9, 2010. Any extension of the term of the obligation is considered a significant modification. 2. Interest paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership on deposits or withdrawable accounts with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under federal or state law if the interest paid or credited can be deducted by the association. 3. Interest on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, but only if the branch is in the commercial banking business.",
        "In most cases, dividend income received from domestic corporations is U.S. source income. Dividend income from foreign corporations is usually foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed later. A substitute dividend payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as a distribution on the transferred security.",
        "A payment of a dividend equivalent amount includes any gross amount that references a U.S. source dividend and that is used to compute any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under a contract, if the taxpayer is the long party under the contract. As a result, a taxpayer may be treated as having received a dividend equivalent payment even if the taxpayer makes a net payment or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero. In 2024, an NPC or ELI will generally be a specified NPC or specified ELI, respectively, if the contract is a delta one transaction. Generally, delta is the ratio of change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the stock referenced by the contract. Generally, the amount of a dividend equivalent for a specified NPC or specified ELI is the per share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares of stock referenced by the contract multiplied by the delta of the contract. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Regulations section 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or its successors) for additional information.",

The only exceptions to this rule are discussed under Employees of foreign persons, organizations, or offices, later, and under Crew members, earlier. If you are an employee and receive compensation for labor or personal services performed both inside and outside the United States, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (other than certain fringe benefits) is sourced on a time basis. Certain fringe benefits (such as housing and education) are sourced on a geographical basis. Or, you may be permitted to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See Alternative Basis, later.",
        "Certain companies selling products through a multilevel marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor, who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, are entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multilevel marketing companies to independent (nonemployee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor are performed and may, depending on the facts, be considered multiyear compensation, with the source of income determined over the period to which such compensation is attributable.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of compensation for labor or personal services from self-employment on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of your particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will call for an apportionment on a time basis, as explained next.",
        "The source of multiyear compensation is generally determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation is attributable. Multiyear compensation is compensation that is included in your income in 1 tax year but that is attributable to a period that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period to which the compensation is attributable based on the facts and circumstances of your case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entire multiyear period. The amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multiyear compensation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in connection with the project.",
        "The amount of fringe benefits must be reasonable and you must substantiate them by adequate records or by sufficient evidence.",

Your principal place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This could be your office, plant, store, shop, or other location. If there is no one place where you spend most of your working time, your main job location is the place where your work is centered, such as where you report for work or are otherwise required to “base” your work. If you have more than one job at any time, your main job location depends on the facts in each case. The most important factors to be considered are: The total time you spend at each place, The amount of work you do at each place, and How much money you earn at each place.",
        "The source of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of your dependents is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. An education fringe benefit includes payments only for the following expenses for education at an elementary or secondary school.

Room and board and uniforms that are required or provided by the school in connection with enrollment or attendance.",
        "The source of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. Your local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that you receive as compensation for local transportation for you or your spouse or dependents at the location of your principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any employer-provided vehicle used predominantly by you, your spouse, or your dependents for local transportation. Actual expenses do not include the cost (including interest) of any vehicle purchased by you or on your behalf.",
        "The source of a moving expense reimbursement is generally based on the location of your new principal place of work. However, the source is determined based on the location of your former principal place of work if you provide sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of your case. Sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for moving expenses that you incur to return to your former principal place of work regardless of whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, your return move to your former principal place of work.",
        "If you are an employee, you can determine the source of your compensation under an alternative basis if you establish to the satisfaction of the IRS that, under the facts and circumstances of your case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation than the time or geographical basis. If you use an alternative basis, you must keep (and have available for inspection) records to document why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation. Also, if your total compensation from all sources is $250,000 or more, check “Yes” to both questions on line K of Schedule OI (Form 1040-NR), and attach a written statement to your tax return that sets forth all of the following. 1. Your name and SSN (entered across the top of the statement). 2. The specific compensation income, or the specific fringe benefit, for which you are using the alternative basis. 3. For each item in (2), the alternative basis of allocation of source used. 4. For each item in (2), a computation showing how the alternative allocation was computed. 5. A comparison of the dollar amount of the U.S. compensation and foreign compensation sourced under both the alternative basis and the time or geographical basis, discussed earlier.",

All income from transportation that begins and ends in the United States is treated as derived from sources in the United States. If the transportation begins or ends in the United States, 50% of the transportation income is treated as derived from sources in the United States. For transportation income from personal services, 50% of the income is U.S. source income if the transportation is between the United States and a U.S. territory.

        "This chapter discusses how to pay your U.S. income tax as you earn or receive income during the year. In general, the federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. There are two ways to pay as you go. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your pay. Tax may also be withheld from certain other income—including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling winnings. In each case, the amount withheld is paid to the U.S. Treasury in your name. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. People who are in business for themselves will generally have to pay their tax this way. You may have to pay estimated tax if you receive income such as dividends, interest, rent, and royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax as well.",
        "You must let your employer know whether you are a resident or a nonresident alien so your employer can withhold the correct amount of tax from your wages. If you are a resident alien under the rules discussed in chapter 1, you must file Form W-9 or a similar statement with your employer. If you are a nonresident alien under those rules, you must furnish to your employer Form 8233 or Form W-8BEN, establishing that you are a foreign person, or Form W-4, establishing that your compensation is subject to graduated withholding at the same rates as resident aliens or U.S. citizens. If you are a resident alien and you receive income other than wages (such as dividends and royalties) from sources within the United States, file Form W-9 or similar statement with the withholding agent (generally, the payer of the income) so the agent will not withhold tax on the income at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you receive this type of income as a nonresident alien, file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent so that the agent will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. However, if the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, file Form W-8ECI instead.",

Wages and other compensation paid to a nonresident alien for services performed as an employee are usually subject to graduated withholding at the same rates as resident aliens and U.S. citizens. Therefore, your compensation, unless it is specifically excluded from the term “wages” by law, or is exempt from tax by treaty, is subject to graduated withholding.",

Also fill out Form W-4 for a scholarship or fellowship grant to the extent it represents payment for past, present, or future services and for which you are not claiming a tax treaty withholding exemption on Form 8233 (discussed later under Income Entitled to Tax Treaty Benefits). These are services you are required to perform as an employee and as a condition of receiving the scholarship or fellowship (or tuition reduction). Nonresident aliens must follow the special instructions in Notice 1392 when completing Form W-4 for compensation paid as employees performing dependent personal services in the United States. Compensation for dependent personal services includes amounts paid as wages, salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions, compensatory scholarships, fellowship income, and similar designations for amounts paid to an employee. To see if you need to have your withholding increased or decreased, use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator.

The rules for withholding and paying over this amount are similar to the rules for sales of U.S. real property interests. You will receive a Form 8288-A reflecting the amount withheld that you may then claim on line 25f of your Form 1040-NR as a credit against the tax you owe on the gain. You may be able to provide certain information to the transferee to reduce or eliminate withholding. For example, if a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies to all of the gain realized on a transfer, the transferee does not need to withhold if you provide a notice describing the application of a nonrecognition provision. If you are a transferee that failed to withhold, under section 1446(f)(4), the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to you an amount equal to the tax you failed to withhold (plus interest, if applicable).

The final regulations require any transferee to withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest (other than certain PTP interests) under section 1446(f)(1), unless an exception to withholding applies. These regulations generally apply to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021. However, in accordance with Notice 2021-51, 2021-36 I.R.B. 361, the rules related to withholding under section 1446(f)(4) and to transfers of PTP interests apply to transfers occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, the final regulations revised certain provisions in Regulations section 1.1446-4 for withholding under section 1446(a) on PTP distributions. Also in accordance with Notice 2021-51, these revisions apply to PTP distributions made on or after January 1, 2023. Notices 2018-8 and 2018-29 apply to transfers that occur before the effective date of the final regulations or, as previously described, taxpayers may apply the proposed regulations to transfers of non-PTP interests during this time.

A list of the areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both) under the Stafford Act is available atFEMA.gov/Disaster ..",
        "If you are reporting a casualty or theft loss attributable to a federally declared disaster, check the box and enter the DR or EM declaration number assigned by FEMA in the space provided above line 1 on your 2024 Form 4684. A list of federally declared disasters and FEMA disaster declaration numbers is available at FEMA.gov/Disaster. The FEMA disaster declaration number consists of the letters “DR” and four numbers, or the letters “EM” and four numbers. For example, enter “DR-4832” in the respective entry spaces for the Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene.",
        "Your home will be considered unsafe only if both of the following apply. Your home is substantially more dangerous after the disaster than it was before the disaster. The danger is from a substantially increased risk of future destruction from the disaster.",
        "When electing to deduct your loss in the preceding year, unless you have a qualified disaster loss, discussed earlier, you must figure the loss under the usual rules for casualty losses, as if it occurred in the year preceding the disaster.",
        "You should adjust your deductions on Form 1040-X. The Instructions for Form 1040-X show how to do this. Explain the reasons for your adjustment and attach Form 4684 to show how you figured your loss. See Figuring a Loss, earlier. If the damaged or destroyed property was nonbusiness property and you didn’t itemize your deductions on your original return, you must first determine whether the casualty loss deduction now makes it advantageous for you to itemize. It is advantageous to itemize if the total of the casualty loss deduction and any other itemized deductions is more than your standard deduction. If you itemize, attach Schedule A (Form 1040) or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR), and Form 4684 to your amended return. Fill out Form 1040-X to refigure your tax to find your refund.",
        "You should keep the records that support your loss deduction. You don’t have to attach them to the amended return. If your records were destroyed or lost, you may have to reconstruct them. Information about reconstructing records is available at IRS.gov/Newsroom/Reconstructing-Records-After-a-Natural-Disaster-or-Casualty-Loss or see Pub. 3067, IRS Disaster Assistance-Federally Declared Disaster Area.",
        "It will be easier to prepare Form 1040-X if you have a copy of your tax return for the preceding year. If you had your tax return completed by a tax preparer, he or she should be able to provide you with a copy of your return. If not, you can get a copy by filing Form 4506 with the IRS. There is a fee for each return requested. However, if your main home, principal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared disaster area, this fee will be waived. Write the name of the disaster in the top margin of Form 4506 (for example, “Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene”).",
        "If your inventory loss qualifies as a casualty loss and is attributable to a federally declared disaster in an area designated by FEMA for public or individual assistance (or both), you may elect to deduct the loss on your return or amended return for the immediately preceding year. However, decrease your opening inventory for the year of the loss so that the loss won’t be reported again in inventories.",
        "If part of your federal disaster loan was canceled under the Stafford Act, it is considered to be reimbursement for the loss. The cancellation reduces your casualty loss deduction.",
        "Don’t include post-disaster relief grants received under the Stafford Act in your income if the grant payments are made to help you meet necessary expenses or serious needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, or funeral expenses. Don’t deduct casualty losses or medical expenses to the extent they are specifically reimbursed by these disaster relief grants. If the casualty loss was specifically reimbursed by the grant and you received the grant after the year in which you deducted the casualty loss, see Reimbursement Received After Deducting Loss, earlier. Unemployment assistance payments under the Stafford Act are taxable unemployment compensation.",
        "A grant that a business receives under a state program to reimburse businesses for losses incurred for damage or destruction of property because of a disaster isn’t excludable from income under the general welfare exclusion, as a gift, as a qualified disaster relief payment (explained next), or as a contribution to capital. However, the business can choose to postpone reporting gain realized from the grant if it buys qualifying replacement property within a certain period of time. See Postponement of Gain, earlier, for the rules that apply.",
        "Qualified disaster relief payments also include amounts paid to individuals affected by the disaster by a federal, state, or local government in connection with a federally declared disaster. These payments must be made from a governmental fund, be based on individual or family needs, and not be compensation for services. Payments to businesses generally don’t qualify.",
        "You cannot take a credit or deduction, or increase the basis in your property, related to any expense for which you were compensated by a qualified wildfire relief payment.",
        "Qualified disaster mitigation payments made under the Stafford Act or the National Flood Insurance Act (as in effect on April 15, 2005) aren’t included in income. These are payments you, as a property owner, receive to reduce the risk of future damage to your property. You can’t increase your basis in the property, or take a deduction or credit, for expenditures made with respect to those payments.",
        "Generally, if you sell or otherwise transfer property, you must recognize any gain or loss for tax purposes unless the property is your main home. You report the gain or deduct the loss on your tax return for the year you realize it. (You can’t deduct a loss on personal-use property unless the loss resulted from a casualty, as discussed earlier.) However, if you sell or otherwise transfer property to the federal government, a state or local government, or an Indian tribal government under a hazard mitigation program, you can choose to postpone reporting the gain if you buy qualifying replacement property within a certain period of time. See Postponement of Gain , earlier, for the rules that apply.",
        "The IRS may postpone for up to 1 year certain tax deadlines of taxpayers who are affected by a federally declared disaster. The tax deadlines the IRS may postpone include those for filing income, excise, and employment tax returns; paying income, excise, and employment taxes; and making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If any tax deadline is postponed, the IRS will publicize the postponement in your area and publish a news release and, where necessary, in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, announcement, or other guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). Go to IRS.gov/DisasterTaxRelief to find out if a tax deadline has been postponed for your area.",
        "If the IRS postpones a tax deadline, the following taxpayers are eligible for the postponement. Any individual whose main home is located in a covered disaster area (defined later). Any business entity or sole proprietor whose principal place of business is located in a covered disaster area. Any individual who is a relief worker affiliated with a recognized government or philanthropic organization and who is assisting in a covered disaster area. Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship whose records are needed to meet a postponed tax deadline, provided those records are maintained in a covered disaster area. The main home or principal place of business doesn’t have to be located in the covered disaster area. Any estate or trust that has tax records necessary to meet a postponed tax deadline, provided those records are maintained in a covered disaster area. The spouse on a joint return with a taxpayer who is eligible for postponements. Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship not located in a covered disaster area, but whose records necessary to meet a postponed tax deadline are located in the covered disaster area. Any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was killed or injured as a result of the disaster. Any other person determined by the IRS to be affected by a federally declared disaster.",
        "This is an area of a federally declared disaster in which the IRS has decided to postpone tax deadlines for up to 1 year.",
        "Certain taxpayers affected by a federally declared disaster that occurs after December 20, 2019, may be eligible for a mandatory 60-day postponement for certain tax deadlines such as filing or paying income, excise, and employment taxes; and making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date that is 60 days after either the earliest incident date or the date of the declaration, whichever is later, is the period during which the deadlines are postponed. For information about disaster relief available in your area, including postponements, go to IRS News Around the Nation.",
        "The IRS may abate the interest and penalties on underpaid income tax for the length of any postponement of tax deadlines.",
        "You can get information from FEMA by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov, or calling the following phone numbers. These numbers are only activated after a federally declared disaster. 800-621-3362. Dial 711 and provide the TRS operator the number 800-621-3362 if you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability.",
        "The disaster year is the tax year in which you sustained the loss attributable to a federally declared disaster. Generally, a disaster loss is sustained in the year the disaster occurred. However, a disaster loss may also be sustained in a year after the disaster occurred. For example, if a claim for reimbursement exists for which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, no part of the loss for which reimbursement may be received is sustained until it can be ascertained with reasonable certainty whether you will be reimbursed.",
        "You must generally deduct a casualty loss in the disaster year. However, if you have a casualty loss from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance (or both), you can elect to deduct that loss on your return or amended return for the tax year immediately preceding the disaster year. If you make this election, the loss is treated as having occurred in the preceding year. A list of areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both) is available at the FEMA website at FEMA.gov/Disaster. You must make the election to take your casualty loss for the disaster in the preceding year on or before the date that is 6 months after the regular due date for filing your original return (without extensions) for the disaster year. If you are a calendar year taxpayer, you have until October 15, 2025, to amend your 2023 tax return to claim a casualty loss that occurred during 2024.",
        "If you have already filed your return for the preceding year, you can elect to claim a disaster loss against that year’s income by filing an amended return. Individuals file an amended return on Form 1040-X. (See How to report the loss on Form 1040-X, later.) To make this election, complete Part I of Section D on the 2023 Form 4684 and attach it to your 2023 return or amended return that claims the disaster loss deduction. You must make an election to deduct the loss in the preceding year on or before the date that is 6 months after the regular due date for filing your original return (without extensions) for the disaster year. For individual calendar year taxpayers, the deadline for electing to take a 2024 disaster loss on your 2023 tax return is October 15, 2025. See the 2023 Instructions for Form 4684 for more detailed information on how to claim these losses on your original or amended 2023 return. If you claimed a deduction for a disaster loss on the tax return for the disaster year and you wish to deduct the loss in the preceding year, you must file an amended return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before the date you file the return or amended return for the preceding year that includes the disaster loss deduction. Claiming a qualifying disaster loss on the previous year’s return may result in a lower tax for that year, often producing or increasing a cash refund..",
        "Complete Part II of Section D on the 2023 Form 4684 if you want to revoke a 2024 disaster year election to deduct a federally declared disaster loss in the preceding tax year. Attach the completed Section D to an amended return for the preceding year (that is, to an amended 2023 return for the revocation of a 2024 disaster year election). Your amended return revoking the election must be filed on or before the date that is 90 days after the due date for making the election and on or before the date you file any return or amended return for the year that includes the disaster loss. Your amended return (revoking the previous disaster loss election) should refigure your tax liability as a result of revoking the election.

        "If your home is located in a federally declared disaster area, your state or local government may order you to tear it down or move it because it is no longer safe to live in because of the disaster. If this happens, treat the loss in value as a casualty loss from a disaster. Your state or local government must issue the order for you to tear down or move the home within 120 days after the area is declared a disaster area. Figure your loss in the same way as for casualty losses of personal-use property. (See Figuring a Loss, earlier.) In determining the decrease in FMV, use the value of your home before you move it or tear it down as its FMV after the casualty.",

        "To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions). Your qualifying child must have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions) for you to claim a higher EIC amount based on that child. If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, but that child doesn't have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you may be eligible to claim a self-only EIC if you are otherwise eligible.

An SSN is valid for the EIC unless it was issued after the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) or it was issued solely to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit and does not authorize you to work. An example of a federally funded benefit is Medicaid. If you, your spouse, or your child has a social security card with “Not valid for employment” printed on it and the immigration status of you, your spouse, or your child has changed so that the individual is now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a social security card without the legend..",

However, if you or your spouse were issued an SSN that wasn't valid for the EIC, but by the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) you or your spouse became eligible for a social security card without \"Not valid for employment\" printed on it, you may claim the EIC on an original or amended 2024 return even if the social security card wasn't updated by the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions).",

For example, in the United States, sales income from inventory is U.S. source income, whether you purchase the inventory in the United States or abroad.

        "If you want to determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first calculate the part of the gain that is less than the total depreciation adjustment for the property. You will allocate this part of the gain to sources within the United States by applying the ratio of the depreciation adjustment to the total depreciation adjustment. The remainder of this part of the gain will be treated as from sources outside the United States. For this purpose, the term “U.S. depreciation adjustment” means the depreciation adjustment allowed in computing taxable income from property in the United States. However, if the property is used primarily in the United States, all depreciation deductions taken in the tax year will be treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. There are, however, some exceptions for certain property used in transportation, communications, and other international use. If the gain from the sale of depreciable property is more than the total depreciation adjustment for the property, the gain will be treated as inventory property as discussed above. The sources of loss are the same as the sources of depreciation deductions. However, if the property is used primarily in the United States, the entire loss will be reduced from the sources of United States income. The property basis is usually the amount you paid for the property (money plus other property or services of fair market value). Depreciation is the amount allowed to be deducted to recover the cost or other basis of property or other assets. The amount you can deduct depends on the cost of the property, when you start using the property, how long it takes to recover the cost, and the depreciation method used. Depreciation deductions are any deductions for depreciation or amortization, or for capital expenditures treated as a deduction for a reasonable expense. ",
        "Non-tangible property includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other similar property. The gain from the sale of depreciable or amortizable non-tangible assets may be up to the amount previously allowed to be depreciated or amortized, and the source of the gain is the same as the source of the original deduction. This is the same as the rules for the sale of depreciable property. See above Depreciable property for details on how to apply this rule. If the sale income depends on the property's production, use, or disposal, then the excess of the depreciation or amortization deduction over the gain is from the country where the property is used. If the income does not depend on the property's production, use, or disposal, then the income is from your tax residence (see above Discussion). If the goodwill payment does not depend on its production, use, or disposal, then the source of the goodwill is the country where the goodwill is generated.",

Typically, the stock dividend equivalent amount is the per-share dividend amount multiplied by the contract’s stock amount, multiplied by the contract’s delta. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Rev. Rul. 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or any subsequent version) for more information.",

This rule has one exception, which is discussed in the following sections: Foreign, Organization, or Office Employees and Crew Members. If you are an employee and you receive compensation for services performed in the United States and elsewhere, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (except for certain additional benefits) is treated as earned on a per-hour basis. Certain additional benefits (such as housing and education) are treated as earned on a per-location basis. Alternatively, you may be allowed to use another basis to determine the source of the compensation. See the following section, Alternative Basis, for more information.",
        "Some companies sell their products through multi-level marketing arrangements, so that the sponsor of the lower-level dealer is entitled to receive a payment from the company based on certain activities of the lower-level dealer. Typically, based on the facts, the payments made by the multi-level marketing companies to independent (non-employee) distributors (upper-level dealers) are based on the sales or purchases of the lower-level dealers they sponsor, and constitute income for personal services performed in recruiting, training, and supporting lower-level distributors. The source of the income is generally determined by the location of the services provided by the upper-level dealer, and based on the facts, can be considered as multi-year compensation, where the source of the income is determined during the period to which the compensation is attributed.",

The many-year compensation is the amount of income included in your tax year, but which may be attributed to two or more tax years. You determine the period of time to which the compensation is attributed, based on your facts and circumstances. For example, the amount of compensation for a period of several calendar years may be attributed to the entire many-year period. Multiply the total many-year compensation by a fraction to determine the amount of compensation treated as having a U.S. source. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or less than a day unit, if applicable) you spent in the United States performing the services for the project.

However, if you provide sufficient evidence to show that the facts and circumstances of your case make a different source more appropriate, you will be reimbursed according to the source determined for your prior principal place of work. Sufficient evidence usually requires a written statement or agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, that was turned into a written form before the relocation and was made to induce you or another employee to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for relocation expenses incurred in returning to your prior principal place of work, whether or not you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location.

There are two ways to pay pay-as-you-go tax. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer may withhold income tax from your wages. Income tax may also be withheld from some other income, including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling income. In either case, the withheld amount will be paid to the U.S. Treasury on your behalf. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay tax through withholding, or if you do not pay enough tax through withholding, you may have to pay estimated tax. Self-employed individuals usually pay tax this way. If you receive dividends, interest, rent, or royalties, you must pay estimated tax. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but also self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax.",

If you are a non-tax resident under these rules, you must file Form 8233 or Form W-8BEN to prove that you are a foreign person; or Form W-4 to prove that your income should be taxed at the same rate as a tax resident or U.S. citizen.

If you receive such income as a non-tax resident, you must file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent, which will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate.
