The inquiry or examination may or may not result in more tax. We may close your case without change; or, you may receive a refund. The process of selecting a return for examination usually begins in one of two ways. First, we use computer programs to identify returns that may have incorrect amounts. These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2, on studies of past examinations, or on certain issues identified by compliance projects. Second, we use information from outside sources that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination.

        "You are a self-employed person if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or an independent contractor. You do not have to carry on regular full-time business activities to be self-employed. Having a part-time business in addition to your regular job or business may be self-employment.. Trade or business. A trade or business is generally an activity carried on to make a profit. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether or not an activity is a trade or business. You do not need to actually make a profit to be in a trade or business as long as you have a profit motive. You do need to make ongoing efforts to further the interests of your business. Limited liability company (LLC). An LLC is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization. Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax.

If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship or a partnership. States with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. A change in your reporting position will be treated as a conversion of the entity. See Pub. 555 for more information about community property laws. Exception—Qualified joint venture (QJV). If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership for the tax year. Making this election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065 but still give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based. For an explanation of \"material participation,\" see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. Only businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a QJV..

Your accounting method includes not only the overall method of accounting you use, but also the accounting treatment you use for any material item. You choose an accounting method for your business when you file your first income tax return that includes a Schedule C for the business. After that, if you want to change your accounting method, you must generally get IRS approval. See Change in Accounting Method, later.",

For more information, see Inventories, later.",
        "Under the cash method, include in your gross income all items of income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year. If you receive property or services, you must include their fair market value in income.",
        "You have constructive receipt of income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to you without restriction. You do not need to have possession of it. If you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you, you are treated as having received it when your agent received it.",

        "You generally cannot deduct or capitalize a business expense until economic performance occurs. If your expense is for property or services provided to you, or for your use of property, economic performance occurs as the property or services are provided or as the property is used. If your expense is for property or services you provide to others, economic performance occurs as you provide the property or services.

Determine the relationship, for this rule, as of the end of the tax year for which the expense or interest would otherwise be deductible. If a deduction is not allowed under this rule, the rule will continue to apply even if your relationship with the person ends before the expense or interest is includible in the gross income of that person.

However, the following restrictions apply. If an inventory is necessary to account for your income, you must generally use an accrual method for purchases and sales. (See, however, Inventories, later.) You can use the cash method for all other items of income and expenses. If you use the cash method for figuring your income, you must use the cash method for reporting your expenses. If you use an accrual method for reporting your expenses, you must use an accrual method for figuring your income. If you use a combination method that includes the cash method, treat that combination method as the cash method.",

If you choose not to keep an inventory, you won’t be treated as failing to clearly reflect income if your method of accounting for inventory treats inventory as non-incidental material or supplies, or conforms to your financial accounting treatment of inventories. If, however, you choose to keep an inventory, you must generally use an accrual method of accounting and value the inventory each year to determine your cost of goods sold in Part III of Schedule C.",

        "You must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year to determine your cost of goods sold (Schedule C, line 42). To determine the value of your inventory, you need a method for identifying the items in your inventory and a method for valuing these items. Inventory valuation rules cannot be the same for all kinds of businesses. The method you use to value your inventory must conform to generally accepted accounting principles for similar businesses and must clearly reflect income. Your inventory practices must be consistent from year to year.",
        "Under the uniform capitalization rules, you must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs for production or resale activities. Include these costs in the basis of property you produce or acquire for resale, rather than claiming them as a current deduction.

This chapter discusses whether you have a disposition, how to figure the gain or loss, and where to report the gain or loss.",
        "An installment sale is a sale of property where you receive at least one payment after the tax year of the sale. If you finance the buyer's purchase of your property, instead of having the buyer get a loan or mortgage from a third party, you probably have an installment sale. For more information about installment sales, see Pub. 537.",
        "The sale of a business is usually not a sale of one asset. Instead, all the assets of the business are sold. Generally, when this occurs, each asset is treated as being sold separately for determining the treatment of gain or loss. Both the buyer and seller involved in the sale of a business must report to the IRS the allocation of the sales price among the business assets. Use Form 8594 , Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060, to provide this information. The buyer and seller should each attach Form 8594 to their federal income tax return for the year in which the sale occurred. For more information about the sale of a business, see Pub. 544.",
        "The adjusted basis of property generally is your original cost or other basis plus certain additions, and minus certain deductions such as depreciation and casualty losses. In determining gain or loss, the costs of transferring property to a new owner, such as selling expenses, are added to the adjusted basis of the property.",
        "Generally, the amount you realize from a disposition is the total of all money you receive plus the fair market value of all property or services you receive. The amount you realize also includes any of your liabilities that were assumed by the buyer and any liabilities to which the property you transferred is subject, such as real estate taxes or a mortgage.",
        "Your gain or loss realized from a disposition of property is usually a recognized gain or loss for tax purposes. Recognized gains must be included in gross income. Recognized losses are deductible from gross income. However, a gain or loss realized from certain exchanges of property is not recognized. See Nontaxable exchanges, earlier. Also, you cannot deduct a loss from the disposition of property held for personal use.",
        "You must classify your gains and losses as either ordinary or capital gains or losses. You must do this to figure your net capital gain or loss. Generally, you will have a capital gain or loss if you dispose of a capital asset. For the most part, everything you own and use for personal purposes or investment is a capital asset. Certain property you use in your business is not a capital asset. A gain or loss from a disposition of this property is an ordinary gain or loss. However, if you held the property longer than 1 year, you may be able to treat the gain or loss as a capital gain or loss. These gains and losses are called section 1231 gains and losses. For more information about ordinary and capital gains and losses, see chapters 2 and 3 of Pub. 544.",
        "If you have a capital gain or loss, you must determine whether it is long term or short term. Whether a gain or loss is long or short term depends on how long you own the property before you dispose of it. The time you own property before disposing of it is called the holding period.",

If there is a connection between any income you receive and your business, the income is business income. A connection exists if it is clear that the payment of income would not have been made if you did not have the business. You can have business income even if you are not involved in the activity on a regular full-time basis. Income from work you do on the side in addition to your regular job can be business income. For example, you may be in the business of providing services for a ride-sharing business as a second job. You report most business income, such as income from selling your products or services, on Schedule C. But you report the income from the sale of business assets, such as land and office buildings, on other forms instead of Schedule C. For information on selling business assets, see chapter 3.",

You are generally considered to provide substantial services for tenants if they are primarily for the tenants' convenience and are not normally provided to maintain the lots in a condition for occupancy. Services are substantial if the compensation for the services makes up a material part of the tenants' rental payments. Examples of services that are not normally provided for the tenants' convenience include supervising and maintaining a recreational hall provided by the park, distributing a monthly newsletter to tenants, operating a laundry facility, and helping tenants buy or sell their trailers. Examples of services that are normally provided to maintain the lots in a condition for tenant occupancy include city sewerage, electrical connections, and roadways.",

You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold. If the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting.

The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price. Next, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.",

You don’t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don’t and the IRS later rules the debt is only partly worthless, you will not be allowed a deduction for the debt in that tax year because a deduction of a partly worthless bad debt is limited to the amount actually charged off.

Treaty income includes, for example, dividends from sources in the United States that are subject to tax at a tax treaty rate not to exceed 15%. Nontreaty income is the gross income of a nonresident alien on which the tax is not limited by an applicable tax treaty. To determine tax on items of income subject to lower tax treaty rates, figure the tax on each separate item of income at the reduced rate that applies to that item under the treaty. To determine tax on nontreaty income, figure the tax at either the flat 30% rate or the graduated rate, depending upon whether or not the income is effectively connected with your trade or business in the United States. Your tax liability is the sum of the tax on treaty income plus the tax on nontreaty income, but it cannot be more than the tax liability figured as if the tax treaty had not come into effect.",

If you are a dual-resident taxpayer, you can still claim the benefits under an income tax treaty. A dual-resident taxpayer is one who is a resident of both the United States and another country under each country's tax laws. The income tax treaty between the two countries must contain a provision that provides for resolution of conflicting claims of residence (tiebreaker rule). If you are treated as a resident of a foreign country under a tax treaty, you are treated as a nonresident alien in figuring your U.S. income tax. For purposes other than figuring your tax, you will be treated as a U.S. resident. For example, the rules discussed here do not affect your residency time periods, as discussed under Dual-Status Aliens, later.",

If the choice is ended in one of the following ways, neither spouse can make this choice in any later tax year. 1. Revocation. Either spouse can revoke the choice for any tax year, provided they make the revocation by the due date for filing the tax return for that tax year. The spouse who revokes the choice must attach a signed statement declaring that the choice is being revoked. The statement must include the name, address, and TIN of each spouse. (If one spouse dies, include the name and address of the person who is revoking the choice for the deceased spouse.) The statement must also include a list of any states, foreign countries, and territories that have community property laws in which either spouse is domiciled or where real property is located from which either spouse receives income. File the statement as follows. 1. If the spouse revoking the choice must file a return, attach the statement to the return for the first year the revocation applies. 2. If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return, but does file a return (for example, to obtain a refund), attach the statement to the return. 3. If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return and does not file a claim for refund, send the statement to the Internal Revenue Service Center where you filed the last joint return. 2. Death. The death of either spouse ends the choice, beginning with the first tax year following the year the spouse died. However, if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident and is entitled to the joint tax rates as a surviving spouse, the choice will not end until the close of the last year for which these joint rates may be used. If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice ends on the first day after the close of the tax year in which the spouses died. 3. Legal separation. A legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance ends the choice as of the beginning of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs. 4. Inadequate records. The IRS can end the choice for any tax year that either spouse has failed to keep adequate books, records, and other information necessary to determine the correct income tax liability, or to provide adequate access to those records.",

Your tax home is the place where you permanently or indefinitely work as an employee or a self-employed individual. If you do not have a regular or main place of business because of the nature of your work, then your tax home is the place where you regularly live. If you do not fit either of these categories, you are considered an itinerant and your tax home is wherever you work.",
        "Inventory property is personal property that is stock in trade or that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of your trade or business. Income from the sale of inventory that you purchased is sourced where the property is sold. Generally, this is where title to the property passes to the buyer. For example, income from the sale of inventory in the United States is U.S. source income, whether you purchased it in the United States or in a foreign country. Income from the sale of inventory property that you produced in the United States and sold outside the United States (or vice versa) is sourced where the property is produced. These rules apply even if your tax home is not in the United States.",
        "To determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first figure the part of the gain that is not more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property. You allocate this part of the gain to sources in the United States based on the ratio of U.S. depreciation adjustments to total depreciation adjustments. The rest of this part of the gain is considered to be from sources outside the United States. For this purpose, “U.S. depreciation adjustments” are the depreciation adjustments to the basis of the property that are allowable in figuring taxable income from U.S. sources. However, if the property is used predominantly in the United States during a tax year, all depreciation deductions allowable for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. But there are some exceptions for certain transportation, communications, and other property used internationally. Gain from the sale of depreciable property that is more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property is sourced as if the property were inventory property, as discussed above. A loss is sourced in the same way as the depreciation deductions were sourced. However, if the property was used predominantly in the United States, the entire loss reduces U.S. source income. The basis of property usually means the cost (money plus the fair market value of other property or services) of property you acquire. Depreciation is an amount deducted to recover the cost or other basis of a trade or business asset. The amount you can deduct depends on the property's cost, when you began using the property, how long it will take to recover your cost, and which depreciation method you use. A depreciation deduction is any deduction for depreciation or amortization or any other allowable deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense.",
        "Intangible property includes patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other like property. The gain from the sale of amortizable or depreciable intangible property, up to the previously allowable amortization or depreciation deductions, is sourced in the same way as the original deductions were sourced. This is the same as the source rule for gain from the sale of depreciable property. See Depreciable property, earlier, for details on how to apply this rule. Gain in excess of the amortization or depreciation deductions is sourced in the country where the property is used if the income from the sale is contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of that property. If the income is not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the income is sourced according to your tax home (discussed earlier). If payments for goodwill do not depend on its productivity, use, or disposition, their source is the country in which the goodwill was generated.",
        "Despite any of the earlier rules, if you do not have a tax home in the United States, but you maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, treat the income from any sale of personal property (including inventory property) that is attributable to that office or place of business as U.S. source income. However, this rule does not apply to sales of inventory property for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if your office or other fixed place of business outside the United States materially participated in the sale. If you have a tax home in the United States but maintain an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States, income from sales of personal property, other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangibles, that is attributable to that foreign office or place of business may be treated as U.S. source income. The income is treated as U.S. source income if an income tax of less than 10% of the income from the sale is paid to a foreign country. This rule also applies to losses if the foreign country would have imposed an income tax of less than 10% had the sale resulted in a gain.",
        "The place or manner of payment is immaterial in determining the source of the income. A substitute interest payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as the interest on the transferred security.",

Interest paid by a resident alien or a domestic corporation on obligations issued before August 10, 2010, if for the 3-year period ending with the close of the payer's tax year preceding the interest payment, at least 80% (0.80) of the payer's total gross income: 1. Is from sources outside the United States, and 2. Is attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business by the individual or corporation in a foreign country or a U.S. territory. However, the interest will be considered U.S. source interest income if either of the following applies. 1. The recipient of the interest is related to the resident alien or domestic corporation. See section 954(d)(3) for the definition of “related person.” 2. The terms of the obligation are significantly modified after August 9, 2010. Any extension of the term of the obligation is considered a significant modification. 2. Interest paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership on deposits or withdrawable accounts with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under federal or state law if the interest paid or credited can be deducted by the association. 3. Interest on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, but only if the branch is in the commercial banking business.",
        "In most cases, dividend income received from domestic corporations is U.S. source income. Dividend income from foreign corporations is usually foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed later. A substitute dividend payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as a distribution on the transferred security.",
        "A payment of a dividend equivalent amount includes any gross amount that references a U.S. source dividend and that is used to compute any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under a contract, if the taxpayer is the long party under the contract. As a result, a taxpayer may be treated as having received a dividend equivalent payment even if the taxpayer makes a net payment or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero. In 2024, an NPC or ELI will generally be a specified NPC or specified ELI, respectively, if the contract is a delta one transaction. Generally, delta is the ratio of change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the stock referenced by the contract. Generally, the amount of a dividend equivalent for a specified NPC or specified ELI is the per share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares of stock referenced by the contract multiplied by the delta of the contract. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Regulations section 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or its successors) for additional information.",

The only exceptions to this rule are discussed under Employees of foreign persons, organizations, or offices, later, and under Crew members, earlier. If you are an employee and receive compensation for labor or personal services performed both inside and outside the United States, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (other than certain fringe benefits) is sourced on a time basis. Certain fringe benefits (such as housing and education) are sourced on a geographical basis. Or, you may be permitted to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See Alternative Basis, later.",
        "Certain companies selling products through a multilevel marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor, who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, are entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multilevel marketing companies to independent (nonemployee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor are performed and may, depending on the facts, be considered multiyear compensation, with the source of income determined over the period to which such compensation is attributable.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of compensation for labor or personal services from self-employment on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of your particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will call for an apportionment on a time basis, as explained next.",
        "The source of multiyear compensation is generally determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation is attributable. Multiyear compensation is compensation that is included in your income in 1 tax year but that is attributable to a period that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period to which the compensation is attributable based on the facts and circumstances of your case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entire multiyear period. The amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multiyear compensation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in connection with the project.",
        "The amount of fringe benefits must be reasonable and you must substantiate them by adequate records or by sufficient evidence.",

Your principal place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This could be your office, plant, store, shop, or other location. If there is no one place where you spend most of your working time, your main job location is the place where your work is centered, such as where you report for work or are otherwise required to “base” your work. If you have more than one job at any time, your main job location depends on the facts in each case. The most important factors to be considered are: The total time you spend at each place, The amount of work you do at each place, and How much money you earn at each place.",
        "The source of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of your dependents is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. An education fringe benefit includes payments only for the following expenses for education at an elementary or secondary school.

Room and board and uniforms that are required or provided by the school in connection with enrollment or attendance.",
        "The source of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. Your local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that you receive as compensation for local transportation for you or your spouse or dependents at the location of your principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any employer-provided vehicle used predominantly by you, your spouse, or your dependents for local transportation. Actual expenses do not include the cost (including interest) of any vehicle purchased by you or on your behalf.",
        "The source of a moving expense reimbursement is generally based on the location of your new principal place of work. However, the source is determined based on the location of your former principal place of work if you provide sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of your case. Sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for moving expenses that you incur to return to your former principal place of work regardless of whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, your return move to your former principal place of work.",
        "If you are an employee, you can determine the source of your compensation under an alternative basis if you establish to the satisfaction of the IRS that, under the facts and circumstances of your case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation than the time or geographical basis. If you use an alternative basis, you must keep (and have available for inspection) records to document why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation. Also, if your total compensation from all sources is $250,000 or more, check “Yes” to both questions on line K of Schedule OI (Form 1040-NR), and attach a written statement to your tax return that sets forth all of the following. 1. Your name and SSN (entered across the top of the statement). 2. The specific compensation income, or the specific fringe benefit, for which you are using the alternative basis. 3. For each item in (2), the alternative basis of allocation of source used. 4. For each item in (2), a computation showing how the alternative allocation was computed. 5.

Nonresident aliens are taxed based on the source of their income and whether or not their income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The following discussions will help you determine if income you receive during the tax year is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and how it is taxed.",
        "Resident aliens are generally taxed in the same way as U.S. citizens. This means that their worldwide income is subject to U.S. tax and must be reported on their U.S. tax return.

Resident aliens use the Tax Table or Tax Computation Worksheets located in the Instructions for Form 1040, which apply to U.S. citizens.",

These are the same rates that apply to U.S. citizens and residents. Income that is not effectively connected is taxed at a flat 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you were formerly a U.S. citizen or resident alien, these rules may not apply. SeeExpatriation Tax , later, in this chapter..",

For transactions in stocks or securities, this applies to any nonresident alien, including a dealer or broker in stocks and securities. For transactions in commodities, this applies to commodities that are usually traded on an organized commodity exchange and to transactions that are usually carried out at such an exchange. This discussion does not apply if you have a U.S. office or other fixed place of business at any time during the tax year through which, or by the direction of which, you carry out your transactions in stocks, securities, or commodities.",

This applies whether or not there is any connection between the income and the trade or business being carried on in the United States during the tax year. Two tests, described under Investment Income , later, determine whether certain items of investment income (such as interest, dividends, and royalties) are treated as effectively connected with that business. In limited circumstances, some kinds of foreign source income may be treated as effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. For a discussion of these rules, see Foreign Income, later.",

If the tests indicate that the item of income is effectively connected, you must include it with your other effectively connected income. If the item of income is not effectively connected, include it with all other income discussed under The 30% Tax, later, in this chapter.",

Personal services income you receive in a tax year in which you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Income received in a year other than the year you performed the services is also effectively connected if it would have been effectively connected if received in the year you performed the services. Personal services income includes wages, salaries, commissions, fees, per diem allowances, and employee allowances and bonuses. The income may be paid to you in the form of cash, services, or property. If you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business only because you perform personal services in the United States during the tax year, income and gains from assets, and gains and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are generally not effectively connected with your trade or business. However, if there is a direct economic relationship between your holding of the asset and your trade or business of performing personal services, the income, gain, or loss is effectively connected.",
        "If you performed personal services in the United States after 1986, and in a later tax year, you receive pension or retirement distributions attributable to these services when you are a nonresident alien, such distributions are effectively connected income to the extent attributable to contributions.

        "“Fixed place of business” generally means a place, site, structure, or other similar facility through which you engage in a trade or business. “Regularly scheduled transportation” means that a ship or aircraft follows a published schedule with repeated sailings or flights at regular intervals between the same points for voyages or flights that begin or end in the United States. This definition applies to both scheduled and chartered air transportation. If you do not meet the two conditions above, the income is not effectively connected and is taxed at a 4% rate. See Transportation Tax, later in this chapter.",

Certain exceptions apply to the look-through rule for distributions by QIEs. A distribution by a QIE with respect to stock regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States is not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder owns 5% or less of that stock (or 10% or less of that stock in the case of a REIT) at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution. A distribution made by a REIT is generally not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder is a qualified shareholder (as described in section 897(k)(3)). A distribution that you do not treat as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest may be included in your gross income as a regular dividend.",

Any stock in a QIE that is held by another QIE will be treated as held by a foreign person if: 1. Any class of stock of such other QIE is regularly traded on an established securities market, or 2. Such other QIE is a RIC that issues certain redeemable securities. Notwithstanding the above, the stock of the QIE will be treated as held by a U.S. person if such other QIE is domestically controlled. 3. Stock in a QIE held by any other QIE not described above will be treated as held by a U.S. person in proportion to the stock of such other QIE that is (or is treated as) held by a U.S. person.",
        "If this occurs, you are treated as having a gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest in an amount equal to the distribution that would have been treated as such gain. This also applies to any substitute dividend payment. A transaction is not treated as an applicable wash sale transaction if: You actually receive the distribution from the domestically controlled QIE related to the interest disposed of, or acquired, in the transaction; or You dispose of any class of stock in a QIE that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States but only if you did not own more than 5% of that class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution.",

Under section 864(c)(8), your gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of that partnership interest is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (“effectively connected gain” or “effectively connected loss”). However, the amount of effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss is limited to the portion of what your distributive share of effectively connected gain or loss would have been had the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the disposition. Section 864(c)(8) applies to sales, exchanges, or other dispositions occurring on or after November 27, 2017. On November 6, 2020, final regulations under section 864(c)(8) were issued applicable to transfers occurring on or after December 26, 2018. See Regulations section 1.864(c)(8)-1(j).",

        "The 30% (or lower treaty) rate applies to the gross amount of U.S. source fixed, determinable, annual, or periodical (FDAP) gains, profits, or income. Income is fixed when it is paid in amounts known ahead of time. Income is determinable whenever there is a basis for figuring the amount to be paid. Income can be periodic if it is paid from time to time. It does not have to be paid annually or at regular intervals. Income can be determinable or periodic even if the length of time during which the payments are made is increased or decreased. Items specifically included as fixed or determinable income are interest (other than OID), dividends, dividend equivalent payments (defined in chapter 2), rents, premiums, annuities, salaries, wages, and other compensation. A substitute dividend or interest payment received under a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is treated the same as the amounts received on the transferred security. Other items of income, such as royalties, may also be subject to the 30% tax. Some fixed or determinable income may be exempt from U.S. tax.

For example, if you have a bank account that earns interest, you must give your SSN or ITIN to the bank. The number must be shown on the Form 1099-INT or other statement the bank sends you. If you do not give the bank your SSN or ITIN, you will be subject to the $50 penalty. (You may also be subject to backup withholding of income tax.)

This penalty does not apply during the automatic 6-month extension of time to file period if you paid at least 90% of your actual tax liability on or before the due date of your return and pay the balance when you file the return. The monthly rate of the failure-to-pay penalty is half the usual rate, 1/4% (0.0025 instead of ½% (0.005)), if an installment agreement is in effect for that month. You must have filed your return by the due date (including extensions) to qualify for this reduced penalty. If a notice of intent to levy is issued, the rate will increase to 1% at the start of the first month beginning at least 10 days after the day that the notice is issued.

        "This chapter discusses how to pay your U.S. income tax as you earn or receive income during the year. In general, the federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. There are two ways to pay as you go. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your pay. Tax may also be withheld from certain other income—including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling winnings. In each case, the amount withheld is paid to the U.S. Treasury in your name. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. People who are in business for themselves will generally have to pay their tax this way. You may have to pay estimated tax if you receive income such as dividends, interest, rent, and royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax as well.",
        "You must let your employer know whether you are a resident or a nonresident alien so your employer can withhold the correct amount of tax from your wages. If you are a resident alien under the rules discussed in chapter 1, you must file Form W-9 or a similar statement with your employer. If you are a nonresident alien under those rules, you must furnish to your employer Form 8233 or Form W-8BEN, establishing that you are a foreign person, or Form W-4, establishing that your compensation is subject to graduated withholding at the same rates as resident aliens or U.S. citizens. If you are a resident alien and you receive income other than wages (such as dividends and royalties) from sources within the United States, file Form W-9 or similar statement with the withholding agent (generally, the payer of the income) so the agent will not withhold tax on the income at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you receive this type of income as a nonresident alien, file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent so that the agent will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. However, if the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, file Form W-8ECI instead.",
        "The following discussion generally applies only to nonresident aliens. Tax is withheld from resident aliens in the same manner as U.S. citizens. Wages and other compensation paid to a nonresident alien for services performed as an employee are usually subject to graduated withholding at the same rates as resident aliens and U.S. citizens. Therefore, your compensation, unless it is specifically excluded from the term “wages” by law, or is exempt from tax by treaty, is subject to graduated withholding.",

These are services you are required to perform as an employee and as a condition of receiving the scholarship or fellowship (or tuition reduction). Nonresident aliens must follow the special instructions in Notice 1392 when completing Form W-4 for compensation paid as employees performing dependent personal services in the United States. Compensation for dependent personal services includes amounts paid as wages, salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions, compensatory scholarships, fellowship income, and similar designations for amounts paid to an employee. To see if you need to have your withholding increased or decreased, use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator.

The rules for withholding and paying over this amount are similar to the rules for sales of U.S. real property interests. You will receive a Form 8288-A reflecting the amount withheld that you may then claim on line 25f of your Form 1040-NR as a credit against the tax you owe on the gain. You may be able to provide certain information to the transferee to reduce or eliminate withholding. For example, if a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies to all of the gain realized on a transfer, the transferee does not need to withhold if you provide a notice describing the application of a nonrecognition provision. If you are a transferee that failed to withhold, under section 1446(f)(4), the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to you an amount equal to the tax you failed to withhold (plus interest, if applicable). On November 30, 2020, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued final regulations under section 1446(f) in T.D. 9926 (85 FR 76910) for transfers of both non-PTP and PTP interests. The final regulations require any transferee to withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest (other than certain PTP interests) under section 1446(f)(1), unless an exception to withholding applies. These regulations generally apply to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021. However, in accordance with Notice 2021-51, 2021-36 I.R.B. 361, the rules related to withholding under section 1446(f)(4) and to transfers of PTP interests apply to transfers occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, the final regulations revised certain provisions in Regulations section 1.1446-4 for withholding under section 1446(a) on PTP distributions. Also in accordance with Notice 2021-51, these revisions apply to PTP distributions made on or after January 1, 2023. Notices 2018-8 and 2018-29 apply to transfers that occur before the effective date of the final regulations or, as previously described, taxpayers may apply the proposed regulations to transfers of non-PTP interests during this time.

However, if you are not a candidate for a degree and the grant does not meet certain requirements, tax will be withheld at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate.

The choice is generally made on the return you file for that year and applies to all your losses on deposits for the year in that particular financial institution. If you treat the loss as a casualty loss, you can’t treat the same amount of the loss as a nonbusiness bad debt when it actually becomes worthless. However, you can take a nonbusiness bad debt deduction for any amount of loss that is more than the estimated amount you deducted as a casualty or ordinary loss. Once you make the choice, you can’t change it without permission from the IRS.",

One way is to deduct the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold by properly reporting your opening and closing inventories. Don’t claim this loss again as a casualty or theft loss. If you take the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold, include any insurance or other reimbursement you receive for the loss in gross income. The other way is to deduct the loss separately. If you deduct it separately, eliminate the affected inventory items from the cost of goods sold by making a downward adjustment to opening inventory or purchases.

You can deduct theft losses that aren’t reimbursable only in the year you discover your property was stolen. If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, the loss isn’t sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be received. If you aren’t sure whether part of your casualty or theft loss will be reimbursed, don’t deduct that part until the tax year when you become reasonably certain that it won’t be reimbursed.

You aren’t entitled to a deduction until your liability under the lease can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Your liability can be determined when a claim for recovery is settled, adjudicated, or abandoned.",
        "This section discusses the special rules that apply to federally declared disaster area losses. It contains information on when you can deduct your loss, how to claim your loss, how to treat your home in a disaster area, and what tax deadlines may be postponed. It also lists Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) phone numbers. (See Contacting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\"), later.) A disaster loss is a loss that occurred in an area determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the federal government under the Stafford Act and that is attributable to a federally declared disaster. Disaster areas include areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both). A federally declared disaster includes a major disaster or emergency declaration. A list of the areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both) under the Stafford Act is available atFEMA.gov/Disaster ..",
        "If you are reporting a casualty or theft loss attributable to a federally declared disaster, check the box and enter the DR or EM declaration number assigned by FEMA in the space provided above line 1 on your 2024 Form 4684. A list of federally declared disasters and FEMA disaster declaration numbers is available at FEMA.gov/Disaster. The FEMA disaster declaration number consists of the letters “DR” and four numbers, or the letters “EM” and four numbers. For example, enter “DR-4832” in the respective entry spaces for the Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene.",
        "Your home will be considered unsafe only if both of the following apply. Your home is substantially more dangerous after the disaster than it was before the disaster. The danger is from a substantially increased risk of future destruction from the disaster.",
        "When electing to deduct your loss in the preceding year, unless you have a qualified disaster loss, discussed earlier, you must figure the loss under the usual rules for casualty losses, as if it occurred in the year preceding the disaster.",
        "You should adjust your deductions on Form 1040-X. The Instructions for Form 1040-X show how to do this. Explain the reasons for your adjustment and attach Form 4684 to show how you figured your loss. See Figuring a Loss, earlier. If the damaged or destroyed property was nonbusiness property and you didn’t itemize your deductions on your original return, you must first determine whether the casualty loss deduction now makes it advantageous for you to itemize. It is advantageous to itemize if the total of the casualty loss deduction and any other itemized deductions is more than your standard deduction. If you itemize, attach Schedule A (Form 1040) or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR), and Form 4684 to your amended return. Fill out Form 1040-X to refigure your tax to find your refund.",
        "It will be easier to prepare Form 1040-X if you have a copy of your tax return for the preceding year. If you had your tax return completed by a tax preparer, he or she should be able to provide you with a copy of your return. If not, you can get a copy by filing Form 4506 with the IRS. There is a fee for each return requested. However, if your main home, principal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared disaster area, this fee will be waived. Write the name of the disaster in the top margin of Form 4506 (for example, “Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene”).",
        "If your inventory loss qualifies as a casualty loss and is attributable to a federally declared disaster in an area designated by FEMA for public or individual assistance (or both), you may elect to deduct the loss on your return or amended return for the immediately preceding year. However, decrease your opening inventory for the year of the loss so that the loss won’t be reported again in inventories.",
        "If part of your federal disaster loan was canceled under the Stafford Act, it is considered to be reimbursement for the loss. The cancellation reduces your casualty loss deduction.",
        "Don’t include post-disaster relief grants received under the Stafford Act in your income if the grant payments are made to help you meet necessary expenses or serious needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, or funeral expenses. Don’t deduct casualty losses or medical expenses to the extent they are specifically reimbursed by these disaster relief grants. If the casualty loss was specifically reimbursed by the grant and you received the grant after the year in which you deducted the casualty loss, see Reimbursement Received After Deducting Loss, earlier. Unemployment assistance payments under the Stafford Act are taxable unemployment compensation.",
        "A grant that a business receives under a state program to reimburse businesses for losses incurred for damage or destruction of property because of a disaster isn’t excludable from income under the general welfare exclusion, as a gift, as a qualified disaster relief payment (explained next), or as a contribution to capital. However, the business can choose to postpone reporting gain realized from the grant if it buys qualifying replacement property within a certain period of time. See Postponement of Gain, earlier, for the rules that apply.",
        "Qualified disaster relief payments also include amounts paid to individuals affected by the disaster by a federal, state, or local government in connection with a federally declared disaster. These payments must be made from a governmental fund, be based on individual or family needs, and not be compensation for services. Payments to businesses generally don’t qualify.",
        "Qualified disaster mitigation payments made under the Stafford Act or the National Flood Insurance Act (as in effect on April 15, 2005) aren’t included in income. These are payments you, as a property owner, receive to reduce the risk of future damage to your property. You can’t increase your basis in the property, or take a deduction or credit, for expenditures made with respect to those payments.",
        "Generally, if you sell or otherwise transfer property, you must recognize any gain or loss for tax purposes unless the property is your main home. You report the gain or deduct the loss on your tax return for the year you realize it. (You can’t deduct a loss on personal-use property unless the loss resulted from a casualty, as discussed earlier.) However, if you sell or otherwise transfer property to the federal government, a state or local government, or an Indian tribal government under a hazard mitigation program, you can choose to postpone reporting the gain if you buy qualifying replacement property within a certain period of time. See Postponement of Gain , earlier, for the rules that apply.",
        "The IRS may postpone for up to 1 year certain tax deadlines of taxpayers who are affected by a federally declared disaster. The tax deadlines the IRS may postpone include those for filing income, excise, and employment tax returns; paying income, excise, and employment taxes; and making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If any tax deadline is postponed, the IRS will publicize the postponement in your area and publish a news release and, where necessary, in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, announcement, or other guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). Go to IRS.gov/DisasterTaxRelief to find out if a tax deadline has been postponed for your area.",

The spouse on a joint return with a taxpayer who is eligible for postponements. Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship not located in a covered disaster area, but whose records necessary to meet a postponed tax deadline are located in the covered disaster area. Any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was killed or injured as a result of the disaster. Any other person determined by the IRS to be affected by a federally declared disaster.",

        "Certain taxpayers affected by a federally declared disaster that occurs after December 20, 2019, may be eligible for a mandatory 60-day postponement for certain tax deadlines such as filing or paying income, excise, and employment taxes; and making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date that is 60 days after either the earliest incident date or the date of the declaration, whichever is later, is the period during which the deadlines are postponed. For information about disaster relief available in your area, including postponements, go to IRS News Around the Nation.",

Dial 711 and provide the TRS operator the number 800-621-3362 if you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability.",
        "The disaster year is the tax year in which you sustained the loss attributable to a federally declared disaster. Generally, a disaster loss is sustained in the year the disaster occurred. However, a disaster loss may also be sustained in a year after the disaster occurred. For example, if a claim for reimbursement exists for which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, no part of the loss for which reimbursement may be received is sustained until it can be ascertained with reasonable certainty whether you will be reimbursed.",
        "You must generally deduct a casualty loss in the disaster year. However, if you have a casualty loss from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance (or both), you can elect to deduct that loss on your return or amended return for the tax year immediately preceding the disaster year. If you make this election, the loss is treated as having occurred in the preceding year. A list of areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both) is available at the FEMA website at FEMA.gov/Disaster. You must make the election to take your casualty loss for the disaster in the preceding year on or before the date that is 6 months after the regular due date for filing your original return (without extensions) for the disaster year.

Individuals file an amended return on Form 1040-X. (See How to report the loss on Form 1040-X, later.) To make this election, complete Part I of Section D on the 2023 Form 4684 and attach it to your 2023 return or amended return that claims the disaster loss deduction.

See the 2023 Instructions for Form 4684 for more detailed information on how to claim these losses on your original or amended 2023 return. If you claimed a deduction for a disaster loss on the tax return for the disaster year and you wish to deduct the loss in the preceding year, you must file an amended return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before the date you file the return or amended return for the preceding year that includes the disaster loss deduction. Claiming a qualifying disaster loss on the previous year’s return may result in a lower tax for that year, often producing or increasing a cash refund..",

Attach the completed Section D to an amended return for the preceding year (that is, to an amended 2023 return for the revocation of a 2024 disaster year election). Your amended return revoking the election must be filed on or before the date that is 90 days after the due date for making the election and on or before the date you file any return or amended return for the year that includes the disaster loss.

Your qualifying child must have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions) for you to claim a higher EIC amount based on that child. If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, but that child doesn't have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you may be eligible to claim a self-only EIC if you are otherwise eligible.

An SSN is valid for the EIC unless it was issued after the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) or it was issued solely to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit and does not authorize you to work. An example of a federally funded benefit is Medicaid. If you, your spouse, or your child has a social security card with “Not valid for employment” printed on it and the immigration status of you, your spouse, or your child has changed so that the individual is now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a social security card without the legend..",

        "Non-tax law residents' agreement income is total income that is limited by the tax treaty. Agreement income includes dividends from U.S. sources, etc., and is taxed at a tax treaty rate of no more than 15%. Non-agreement income is total income that is not limited by the tax treaty for non-tax law residents. To determine the tax on income that is taxed at the lower tax treaty rate, calculate the tax on agreement income under the lower tax rate applicable to the income under the agreement. To determine the tax on non-agreement income, calculate the tax at a flat rate of 30% or a progressive rate, depending on whether the income is effectively linked to your U.S. trade or business. Your tax liability is the total of the tax on agreement income and the tax on non-agreement income, but not more than the tax liability calculated before the tax treaty goes into effect.",
        "Below is a brief description of the exemptions available for personal service income, remittances, scholarships, fellowships, and capital gains under tax treaties. The conditions for claiming exemptions vary from treaty to treaty.

That website also provides technical explanations for many of the treaties. Also, see Publication 901 (English). Tax treaty exemptions also cover dividends, interest, rents, royalties, pensions, and annuities. These types of income may be exempt from U.S. taxes or taxed at a lower rate. For more information, see Publication 901 (English) or the applicable tax treaty.",
        "Under most tax treaties, residents of treaty countries who are not tax residents by definition, and dual-status residents who temporarily provide services in the United States and are beneficial to the treaty country (see Chapter 1), may qualify for a partial or total exemption from United States tax on their personal income, if they meet the applicable treaty provisions.",

        "According to many tax treaties, non-resident foreign teachers or professors who are visiting the United States primarily for teaching at a university or other approved educational institution are exempt from paying United States income tax on teaching income for the first two or three years after arrival in the United States. Many treaties provide exemptions for participation in research. In general, the purpose of the teacher or professor in the United States is teaching, lecturing, advising, or conducting research. The person must spend most of his or her time on these duties. The normal duties of a teacher or professor include not only formal classroom work (involving regular arrangements of lectures, demonstrations, or other student-participating activities), but also informal presentation of methods in seminars or other informal groups, and in laboratory sessions.",
        "All agreements contain provisions for the exemption of income earned by certain foreign government employees. However, there are differences among the agreements as to who is eligible for this benefit. Under many agreements, a foreign national who is a resident of the United States is not eligible. Under most agreements, a non-national or non-citizen of the foreign government is not eligible. Foreign government employees should carefully read the relevant agreement to determine whether they are eligible for the benefit. Chapter 10 of this publication (in English) also contains information applicable to foreign government employees.",
        "Under some tax treaties, students, apprentices, and interns are exempt from tax on remittances from abroad for tuition and living expenses.

If you entered the United States as a non-tax resident but are now a tax resident, the treaty exemption still applies.

For example, in the United States, income from the sale of inventory is U.S. source income, whether you purchase the inventory in the United States or abroad. You earn revenue from the sale of inventory property in the country where the property is produced. Even if your tax residence is not in the United States, these rules apply.",
        "If you are to determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first calculate the portion of the gain that is not in excess of the total depreciation adjustment. You will allocate this portion of the gain to the U.S. source by applying the ratio of U.S. depreciation adjustment to total depreciation adjustment. The remainder of the gain will be considered to be from a source other than the U.S. For this purpose, 'U.S. depreciation adjustment item' is depreciation allowed in computing taxable income from property based on depreciation. However, if the property is primarily used in the U.S. during the tax year, all depreciation deductions allowed for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation. However, there are certain exceptions for property used in international transportation, communications, and other activities. As stated above, the source of gain from the sale of depreciable assets is inventory assets. The source of loss is the same as the source of depreciation deduction. However, if the property is primarily used in the U.S., the entire loss will be reduced from U.S. income. The cost basis of property is generally the amount you paid for the property (money plus the fair market value of other property or services). Depreciation is the amount you deduct to recover the cost of trade or business assets or other basis. The amount you can deduct depends on the cost of the property, the time you begin to use the property, the time required to recover the cost, and the depreciation method you use. Depreciation deductions are any deductions for depreciation or amortization, or any other allowed deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense. ",

This is the same as the rules for the source of income from the sale of depreciable assets. See the section on Depreciable Property in the following text for details on how to apply this rule. If the income from the sale is dependent on the productivity, use, or disposal of the property, then the excess of the depreciation or amortization deduction is from the country where the property is used. If the income is not dependent on the productivity, use, or disposal of the property, then the income is from your tax residence (as discussed in the preceding text). If payments for goodwill are not dependent on its productivity, use, or disposal, then its source is the country where the goodwill is created.",

However, if your office or other fixed place of business abroad is substantially involved in the sale, this rule does not apply to the sale of inventory used, disposed of, or consumed abroad. If you have a tax home in the United States but have an office or other fixed place of business abroad, income from the sale of personal property (other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangible assets) may be attributed to a foreign office or place of business as United States source income. If the income paid to a foreign country is less than 10 percent of the selling price, the income will be treated as United States source income. If a foreign country levies a tax on the sale resulting in a gain that is less than 10 percent, this rule also applies to losses.",

For 2023, if the contract is a hedge of one, the designated nominal principal contract or the stock link instrument is usually a designated nominal principal contract or a designated stock link instrument. In general, the hedge value is the fair market value change of the designated nominal principal contract or the stock link instrument divided by the fair market value change of the contract's stock number. In general, the stock dividend equivalent amount for a specific designated nominal principal contract or a specific stock link instrument is the stock dividend amount per share multiplied by the contract's stock number multiplied by the contract's hedge value.

        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of self-employment or personal service income based on the facts and circumstances of your particular situation, in order to most accurately reflect the source of the income.

Annual salary is the amount of salary included in your income for a tax year that is attributed to a period of time that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period of time for which the salary is paid based on the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, the amount of salary attributed to a period of time that spans multiple calendar years is attributed to the entire years. The amount of salary from the United States is calculated by multiplying the total amount of annual salary by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or less than a day unit, such as a partial day) you worked or provided personal services for the case in the United States. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or less than a day unit, if appropriate) you worked or provided personal services for the case.",

Sufficient evidence usually requires a written statement from you and your employer, or a written statement from the company that was simplified into written form before the move and was established to encourage you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will compensate you for moving expenses incurred before returning to your former principal place of work, whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location.

However, if you purchase property similar to or in the same service or use as the stolen or damaged property within the specified replacement period, you can choose to defer reporting the gain, discussed below. If you purchase the controlling interest (at least 80%) in a company that owns property similar to or in the same service or use as the stolen or damaged property, you can also choose to defer reporting the gain. See Controlling interest in a corporation. If you have gain from damaged property, you can defer reporting the gain as long as you restore the property to its original condition with the compensation. To defer reporting all the gain, your cost of replacing the property must be at least equal to the amount of the compensation. If the cost of replacing the property is less than the amount of the compensation, you must include the gain in your income, but only to the extent of the unused compensation.",
        "Regarding the accidents and thefts described in (3) above, any losses cannot be offset against the gross income in determining whether the gross income exceeds $100,000. If the property is owned by a partnership, the $100,000 limit applies to the partnership and each partner. If the property is owned by an S corporation, the $100,000 limit applies to the S corporation and each shareholder.",
        "If a taxpayer dies after receiving income but before purchasing an alternative asset, the income must be reported in the year the taxpayer realized the income. The executor of a will or a person who receives funds from an accident or theft cannot delay filing the income by purchasing an alternative asset.",
        "If the compensation you receive for a destroyed principal residence exceeds the amount you can exclude from your income (see Principal Residence destroyed, which is discussed in the Calculating income section above), you can defer reporting excess income by purchasing an alternative property that is similar or related in service or use. If you defer reporting all of your excess income, the cost of the alternative property must be at least equal to the amount you received for the destruction, minus the amount of income excluded. In addition, if you defer reporting any part of your income under these rules, you will be treated as having owned and used the alternative property as your principal residence during the period you owned and used the destroyed property as your principal residence.",
        "If two or more properties are of the same class, the reduction is allocated to each property in proportion to the adjusted base of all properties in that class. The base of any single property's reduction cannot be less than zero.",
        "If you want to postpone reporting your income, you must purchase alternative property within the specified time period. This is the replacement period. The replacement period begins on the date of your property's damage, destruction, or theft. The replacement period usually ends two years after the first tax year in which you realize any part of the income.",
        "For principal residences (or personal property within a principal residence) located in a declared disaster area, the replacement period generally ends after the first tax year in which you realize any part of the gain. See the section on disaster losses in this publication.",

Copies of the tax returns that contain the non-voluntary exchange of property income and related income deferral, and 7. A description of the action taken in connection with the exchange of property.",
        "You can delay reporting your income from an accident or theft by choosing to report it on your tax return in the year you receive the insurance payout or other compensation that creates the income. If the stolen or damaged property is owned by a partnership or corporation, only the partnership or corporation can choose to delay reporting the income.",
        "You should attach a statement to your tax return for the year you received the income. The statement should include the following. Date and details of the accident or theft. Any insurance compensation or other compensation you received from the accident or theft. How you calculated the income.",
        "If you purchased an alternative asset before filing your tax return in the year you received the income, your return should also include detailed information on the following. Alternative asset. Deferred income. Adjusted basis reflecting deferred income. Any income you report as income.",
        "Once you have acquired an eligible alternative property specified as an alternative property in the statement attached to the tax return, you cannot replace other eligible alternative property. Even if you acquire other property during the replacement period, this also applies. However, if you find that the original alternative property is not an eligible alternative property, you can (within the replacement period) replace a new eligible alternative property.",
        "In either of the following situations, you must file an amended return (form 1040-X) for the tax year in which you received the income. You did not receive alternative property within the required replacement period and extension period. In the amended return, you must report the income and pay any additional tax due. You received alternative property within the required replacement period and extension period, but the cost was less than the amount you received from the accident or theft. In the amended return, you must report the non-deferred portion of the income and pay any additional tax due.",
        "If the insurance or other compensation you receive exceeds your adjusted basis in your destroyed or stolen property, you will have a gain from the accident or theft. You must include this gain in your income for the year you receive the compensation, unless you choose to defer reporting the gain, as discussed earlier.",
        "Generally, you can only deduct the loss of property that was not compensated for in the tax year in which the accident occurred. Even if you do not repair or replace the damaged property until the following year, this is also true. (However, please see the exception in the following text for the loss of disaster area.) You can only deduct the loss of theft in the year in which you discover the theft of the property. If there is a reasonable expectation of compensation in the year in which the accident occurred, the loss has not been established until you have reasonably determined that you will receive such compensation. If you are unsure whether part of your accident or theft loss will be compensated, do not deduct that part of the loss until you have reasonably determined that you will receive compensation in the tax year in which the loss was established. The later tax year is the year in which the loss was established.",
        "If your loss is due to a financial institution that is unable to repay or bankrupt, please refer to the previous text on deposit losses.",
        "If you rent property from others, you can deduct the loss of that property in the year in which you determine the liability for the loss. Even if the loss occurs in a different year or the year in which you fulfill your obligation to make a claim is different, this is still true. You are not entitled to a deduction until your obligation under the lease can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Your obligation can be determined when the claim is settled, adjudicated or abandoned.",
        "This section discusses special rules for losses declared by the federal government. It contains information on when you can deduct losses, how to file a claim, how to handle your home in the disaster area, and which tax deadlines can be extended. It also lists the phone numbers for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). (See the contact information for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the text below.) Disaster losses are losses that occur in a disaster area declared by the President of the United States under the Stafford Act, which can be attributed to a disaster declared by the federal government. A disaster area includes a place that requires public or private assistance (or both). A federal disaster declaration includes a major disaster or an emergency declaration. The list of areas that require public or private assistance (or both) under the Stafford Act can be found at FEMA.gov/Disasters (English). ",
        "If you are reporting an accidental injury or theft resulting from a federally declared disaster, check this box and enter the FEMA Disaster Declaration Number (DR or EM) provided on the 2024 Form 4684, line 1 above the blank space provided. The list of federally declared disasters and the FEMA Disaster Declaration Numbers can be found at FEMA.gov/Disasters (English).

For example, for the tornado in Tennessee, enter “DR-4832” in the corresponding input box.",
        "Your home is only considered unsafe when both of the following conditions are true. After a disaster, your home is more dangerous than before the disaster. The danger comes from the greatly increased risk of future disasters causing damage.",
        "When you elect to deduct losses in the year before the disaster, unless you have a qualified disaster loss as discussed above, you must calculate the loss as if it occurred in the year before the disaster. ",
        "You should adjust your deductions on Form 1040-X. The instructions for Form 1040-X show how to do this. Explain the reason for the adjustment and attach Form 4684 to show how you calculated your loss. See the discussion of Calculating Losses in this chapter. If the property damaged or destroyed is nonbusiness property and you did not list the deduction on your original return line by line, you must first determine whether the loss deduction from an accidental loss is favorable to you. If the loss deduction from an accidental loss and any other line item deductions total more than your standard deduction, listing line item deductions is favorable. If you list line item deductions, attach Schedule A (Form 1040) or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR), and Form 4684 to your modified return. File Form 1040-X to recalculate your tax to arrive at your refund amount.",
        "If you have a copy of your tax return from last year, filling out Form 1040-X will be easier. If your tax return was prepared by a tax preparer, he or she should be able to provide you with a copy of your tax return. If not, you can obtain a copy by submitting Form 4506 to the IRS. Each request for a tax return requires a fee. However, if your principal place of residence, principal place of business, or tax home is located in a federal disaster area, the fee will be waived. Write the name of the disaster (for example, 'Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene') in the blank space at the top of Form 4506.",
        "If your inventory loss qualifies as an accidental loss and is due to a disaster that occurred in a public or private assistance (or both) area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you may choose to deduct the loss on your tax return for the year in which the loss occurred. However, reduce the loss by the beginning-of-year inventory when reporting the loss again in inventory. ",
        "If your portion of the federal disaster loan is forgiven under the Stafford Act, it is considered compensation for the loss. The forgiveness will reduce your loss of accident deduction.",
        "If disaster relief grants received under the Stafford Act are used to help you meet the necessary expenses or severe needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, or burial expenses, do not include them in your income. Do not deduct these disaster relief grants as compensation for an accident loss or medical expenses. If an accident loss is specially compensated by the grant, and you receive the grant after deducting the accident loss in the year following the accident, see the discussion of compensation received after deducting losses in the preceding section. Unemployment compensation under the Stafford Act is taxable unemployment relief.",
        "Companies that receive and use grants from state plans to compensate for property damage or destruction caused by disasters are not allowed to treat the grants as general benefits, gifts, or qualified disaster relief (discussed below), or as an investment in capital from which income is excluded. However, if a company purchases eligible replacement property within a specified period, the company may elect to defer reporting the income realized from the grant. Please refer to the section on Deferring Income for more information on the applicable rules.",
        "The eligible disaster assistance also includes amounts paid by the federal, state, or local government to individuals affected by the declared disaster. These amounts must be paid from government funds, based on the need of the individual or family, rather than on the basis of service rendered. Assistance provided to businesses is generally not eligible.",
        "Under the Stafford Act or the National Flood Insurance Act (effective April 15, 2005), eligible disaster relief payments are not included in income. These are payments you receive as a property owner to reduce the risk of damage to your property in the future. After using these payments, you cannot increase your property base by using them, nor can you claim a deduction or credit.",
        "Generally, if you sell or otherwise dispose of property, unless the property is your principal residence, you must report any gain or loss for tax purposes. You report the gain or deduct the loss on your tax return for the year in which you realize the gain or loss. (You cannot deduct a loss from the sale of personal-use property, unless the loss is from an accidental event, as described above.) However, if you dispose of property by disaster relief sale to a federal, state, or local government or Indian tribal government, and you purchase a qualifying replacement property within a specified time, you may be able to defer reporting the gain for a specified period.
