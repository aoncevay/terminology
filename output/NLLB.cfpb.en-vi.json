        "2025 modified AGI limits. You can find information about the 2025 contribution and modified AGI limits in Pub. 590-A. Tax law changes for 2025. When you figure how much income tax you want withheld from your pay and when you figure your estimated tax, consider tax law changes effective in 2025. For more information, see Pub. 505. Alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount increased. The AMT exemption amount is increased to $85,700 ($133,300 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse; $66,650 if married filing separately). The income levels at which the AMT exemption begins to phase out have increased to $609,350 ($1,218,700 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse). New reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP) changed the reporting requirements for third-party settlement organizations. Beginning in 2024, there are lower reporting thresholds for Form 1099-K. See chapter 8, later. Updated reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. For 2024, payment card companies, payment apps, and online marketplaces will be required to send you a Form 1099-K when the amount of your business transactions during the year is more than $5,000. In calendar year 2025, the threshold will lower to more than $2,500; and for 2026 and later years, the threshold will be more than $600. Changes to reporting amounts from Form 1099-K. Beginning in 2024, if you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error or for personal items sold at a loss, you will now enter these amounts in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1 (Form 1040).",

        "Pub. 17 closely follows Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, and their three Schedules 1 through 3. Pub. 17 is divided into four parts. Each part is further divided into chapters, most of which generally discuss one line of the form or one line of one of the three schedules. The introduction at the beginning of each part lists the schedule(s) discussed in that part. The table of contents inside the front cover, the introduction to each part, and the index in the back of the publication are useful tools to help you find the information you need.",

        "It will help you identify which filing status you qualify for, whether you can claim any dependents, and whether the income you receive is taxable. The publication goes on to explain the standard deduction, the kinds of expenses you may be able to deduct, and the various kinds of credits you may be able to take to reduce your tax. Throughout this publication are examples showing how the tax law applies in typical situations. Also throughout this publication are flowcharts and tables that present tax information in an easy-to-understand manner. Many of the subjects discussed in this publication are discussed in greater detail in other IRS publications. References to those other publications are provided for your information.",

They also provide information about dependents, and discuss recordkeeping requirements, IRS e-file (electronic filing), certain penalties, and the two methods used to pay tax during the year: withholding and estimated tax. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; and Schedule 3, Part II, Other Payments and Refundable Credits.",

They explain which income is and isn\u2019t taxed and discuss some of the adjustments to income that you can make in figuring your adjusted gross income. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; Schedule 2, Part II, Other Taxes; and Schedule 3, Part II, Other Payments and Refundable Credits.",
        "After you have figured your adjusted gross income, you are ready to subtract the deductions used to figure taxable income. You can subtract either the standard deduction or itemized deductions, and, if you qualify, the qualified business income deduction. Itemized deductions are deductions for certain expenses that are listed on Schedule A (Form 1040). The three chapters in this part discuss the standard deduction and certain itemized deductions. See chapter 10 for the factors to consider when deciding whether to take the standard deduction or itemized deductions. The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these chapters are: Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; Schedule 2, Part II, Other Taxes; and Schedule 3, Part I, Nonrefundable Credits.",

        "We accept most taxpayers\u2019 returns as filed. If we inquire about your return or select it for examination, it does not suggest that you are dishonest. The inquiry or examination may or may not result in more tax. We may close your case without change; or, you may receive a refund. The process of selecting a return for examination usually begins in one of two ways. First, we use computer programs to identify returns that may have incorrect amounts. These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2, on studies of past examinations, or on certain issues identified by compliance projects. Second, we use information from outside sources that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination. Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, explains the rules and procedures that we follow in examinations. The following sections give an overview of how we conduct examinations.",
        "If you do not agree with the examiner's proposed changes, you can appeal them to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. Most differences can be settled without expensive and time-consuming court trials. Your appeal rights are explained in detail in both Pub. 5, Your Appeal Rights and How to Prepare a Protest if You Don't Agree, and Pub. 556. If you do not wish to use the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or disagree with its findings, you may be able to take your case to the U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or the U.S. District Court where you live. If you take your case to court, the IRS will have the burden of proving certain facts if you kept adequate records to show your tax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and meet certain other conditions. If the court agrees with you on most issues in your case and finds that our position was largely unjustified, you may be able to recover some of your administrative and litigation costs. You will not be eligible to recover these costs unless you tried to resolve your case administratively, including going through the appeals system, and you gave us the information necessary to resolve the case.",

However, we sometimes talk with other persons if we need information that you have been unable to provide, or to verify information we have received. If we do contact other persons, such as a neighbor, a bank, an employer, or employees, we will generally need to tell them limited information, such as your name. The law prohibits us from disclosing any more information than is necessary to obtain or verify the information we are seeking.

This publication has information on business income, expenses, and tax credits that may help you, as a small business owner, file your income tax return.",
        "You are a self-employed person if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or an independent contractor. You do not have to carry on regular full-time business activities to be self-employed. Having a part-time business in addition to your regular job or business may be self-employment.. Trade or business. A trade or business is generally an activity carried on to make a profit. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether or not an activity is a trade or business. You do not need to actually make a profit to be in a trade or business as long as you have a profit motive. You do need to make ongoing efforts to further the interests of your business. Limited liability company (LLC). An LLC is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization. Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax. For more information on determining whether you are an employee or independent contractor, see Pub. 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide.",

        "If you and your spouse jointly own and operate an unincorporated business and share in the profits and losses, you are partners in a partnership, whether or not you have a formal partnership agreement. Do not use Schedule C. Instead, file Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income. For more information, see Pub. 541, Partnerships. Exception\u2014Community income. If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship or a partnership. States with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. A change in your reporting position will be treated as a conversion of the entity. See Pub. 555 for more information about community property laws. Exception\u2014Qualified joint venture (QJV). If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership for the tax year. Making this election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065 but still give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based. For an explanation of \"material participation,\" see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. Only businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a QJV.. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. Each of you must file a separate Schedule C and a separate Schedule SE. For more information, see Qualified Joint Ventures in the Instructions for Schedule SE.",

If your expenses are less than your income, the difference is net profit and becomes part of your income on line 3 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). If your expenses are more than your income, the difference is a net loss. You can usually deduct it from gross income on line 3 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). But in some situations your loss is limited. This chapter briefly explains three of those situations. Other situations that may limit your loss are explained in the instructions for Schedule C, line G and line 32.

If you use either or both optional methods, you must figure and pay the SE tax due under these methods even if you would have had a smaller tax or no tax using the regular method.

The inquiry or examination may or may not result in more tax. We may close your case without change or you may receive a refund.

These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2; on studies of past examinations; or on certain issues identified by other special projects. Another way is to use information from compliance projects that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination.

        "The cost or purchase price of property is usually its basis for figuring the gain or loss from its sale or other disposition. However, if you acquired the property by gift, by inheritance, or in some way other than buying it, you must use a basis other than its cost. For more information about basis, see Pub. 551, Basis of Assets.",
        "The adjusted basis of property generally is your original cost or other basis plus certain additions, and minus certain deductions such as depreciation and casualty losses.

Also, you cannot deduct a loss from the disposition of property held for personal use.",

Generally, you will have a capital gain or loss if you dispose of a capital asset. For the most part, everything you own and use for personal purposes or investment is a capital asset. Certain property you use in your business is not a capital asset. A gain or loss from a disposition of this property is an ordinary gain or loss. However, if you held the property longer than 1 year, you may be able to treat the gain or loss as a capital gain or loss. These gains and losses are called section 1231 gains and losses. For more information about ordinary and capital gains and losses, see chapters 2 and 3 of Pub. 544.",
        "If you have a capital gain or loss, you must determine whether it is long term or short term. Whether a gain or loss is long or short term depends on how long you own the property before you dispose of it. The time you own property before disposing of it is called the holding period.",

A connection exists if it is clear that the payment of income would not have been made if you did not have the business. You can have business income even if you are not involved in the activity on a regular full-time basis. Income from work you do on the side in addition to your regular job can be business income. For example, you may be in the business of providing services for a ride-sharing business as a second job. You report most business income, such as income from selling your products or services, on Schedule C. But you report the income from the sale of business assets, such as land and office buildings, on other forms instead of Schedule C. For information on selling business assets, see chapter 3.",

You are generally considered to provide substantial services for tenants if they are primarily for the tenants' convenience and are not normally provided to maintain the lots in a condition for occupancy. Services are substantial if the compensation for the services makes up a material part of the tenants' rental payments. Examples of services that are not normally provided for the tenants' convenience include supervising and maintaining a recreational hall provided by the park, distributing a monthly newsletter to tenants, operating a laundry facility, and helping tenants buy or sell their trailers.

Do this by crediting the purchases or sales account with the cost of merchandise you withdraw for personal use. You must also charge the amount to your drawing account. A drawing account is a separate account you should keep to record the business income you withdraw to pay for personal and family expenses. As stated above, you also use it to record withdrawals of merchandise for personal or family use. This account is also known as a withdrawals account or personal account.",
        "Labor costs are usually an element of cost of goods sold only in a manufacturing or mining business. Small merchandisers (wholesalers, retailers, etc.) usually do not have labor costs that can properly be charged to cost of goods sold. In a manufacturing business, labor costs properly allocable to the cost of goods sold include both the direct and indirect labor used in fabricating the raw material into a finished, saleable product.",
        "Direct labor costs are the wages you pay to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. They also include a part of the wages you pay to employees who work directly on the product part time if you can determine that part of their wages.",
        "Indirect labor costs are the wages you pay to employees who perform a general factory function that does not have any immediate or direct connection with making the saleable product, but that is a necessary part of the manufacturing process.",
        "Other labor costs not properly chargeable to the cost of goods sold can be deducted as selling or administrative expenses. Generally, the only kinds of labor costs properly chargeable to your cost of goods sold are the direct or indirect labor costs and certain other costs treated as overhead expenses properly charged to the manufacturing process, as discussed later under Line 39\u2014Other Costs.",
        "Materials and supplies, such as hardware and chemicals, used in manufacturing goods are charged to cost of goods sold.

Returns and allowances include cash or credit refunds you make to customers, rebates, and other allowances off the actual sales price. Next, subtract the cost of goods sold (line 4) from net receipts (line 3). The result is the gross profit from your business.",
        "You do not have to figure the cost of goods sold if the sale of merchandise is not an income-producing factor for your business. Your gross profit is the same as your net receipts (gross receipts minus any refunds, rebates, or other allowances).

Use inventory forms and adding machine tapes as the only evidence for your inventory. Inventory forms are available at office supply stores. These forms have columns for recording the description, quantity, unit price, and value of each inventory item. Each page has space to record who made the physical count, who priced the items, who made the extensions, and who proofread the calculations. These forms will help you confirm that the total inventory is accurate. They will also provide you with a permanent record to support its validity. Inventories are discussed in chapter 2.",
        "If you are in a retail or wholesale business, you can check the accuracy of your gross profit figure. First, divide gross profit by net receipts. The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price. Next, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.",

The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on your income statement are $300,000. Your cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 \u2212 $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, you divide gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000).

These are costs you do not have to capitalize or include in the cost of goods sold but can deduct in the current year. To be deductible, a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your field of business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary. For more information about the general rules for deducting business expenses, see section 162 and its regulations. If you have an expense that is partly for business and partly personal, separate the personal part from the business part. The personal part is not deductible..",

Rent paid to a related person is reasonable if it is the same amount you would pay to a stranger for use of the same property. Rent is not unreasonable just because it is figured as a percentage of gross receipts. Related persons include members of your immediate family, including siblings (either whole or half), your spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. For a list of the other related persons, see section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code.",

        "A nonresident alien's treaty income is the gross income on which the tax is limited by a tax treaty. Treaty income includes, for example, dividends from sources in the United States that are subject to tax at a tax treaty rate not to exceed 15%. Nontreaty income is the gross income of a nonresident alien on which the tax is not limited by an applicable tax treaty. To determine tax on items of income subject to lower tax treaty rates, figure the tax on each separate item of income at the reduced rate that applies to that item under the treaty. To determine tax on nontreaty income, figure the tax at either the flat 30% rate or the graduated rate, depending upon whether or not the income is effectively connected with your trade or business in the United States. Your tax liability is the sum of the tax on treaty income plus the tax on nontreaty income, but it cannot be more than the tax liability figured as if the tax treaty had not come into effect.",

A substantial part of that person's time must be devoted to those duties. The normal duties of a teacher or professor include not only formal classroom work involving regularly scheduled lectures, demonstrations, or other student-participation activities, but also the less formal method of presenting ideas in seminars or other informal groups and in joint efforts in the laboratory.

        "Do not count the days you intended to leave, but could not leave, the United States because of a medical condition or problem that arose while you were in the United States. Whether you intended to leave the United States on a particular day is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. For example, you may be able to establish that you intended to leave if your purpose for visiting the United States could be accomplished during a period that is not long enough to qualify you for the substantial presence test. However, if you need an extended period of time to accomplish the purpose of your visit and that period would qualify you for the substantial presence test, you would not be able to establish an intent to leave the United States before the end of that extended period. In the case of an individual who is judged mentally incompetent, proof of intent to leave the United States can be determined by analyzing the individual's pattern of behavior before they were judged mentally incompetent. If you qualify to exclude days of presence because of a medical condition, you must file a fully completed Form 8843 with the IRS. See Form 8843, later. You cannot exclude any days of presence in the United States under the following circumstances. You were initially prevented from leaving, were then able to leave, but remained in the United States beyond a reasonable period for making arrangements to leave. You returned to the United States for treatment of a medical condition that arose during a prior stay. The condition existed before your arrival in the United States and you were aware of the condition.

Income from the sale of inventory that you purchased is sourced where the property is sold. Generally, this is where title to the property passes to the buyer. For example, income from the sale of inventory in the United States is U.S. source income, whether you purchased it in the United States or in a foreign country. Income from the sale of inventory property that you produced in the United States and sold outside the United States (or vice versa) is sourced where the property is produced. These rules apply even if your tax home is not in the United States.",
        "To determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first figure the part of the gain that is not more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property. You allocate this part of the gain to sources in the United States based on the ratio of U.S. depreciation adjustments to total depreciation adjustments. The rest of this part of the gain is considered to be from sources outside the United States. For this purpose, \u201cU.S. depreciation adjustments\u201d are the depreciation adjustments to the basis of the property that are allowable in figuring taxable income from U.S. sources. However, if the property is used predominantly in the United States during a tax year, all depreciation deductions allowable for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. But there are some exceptions for certain transportation, communications, and other property used internationally. Gain from the sale of depreciable property that is more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property is sourced as if the property were inventory property, as discussed above. A loss is sourced in the same way as the depreciation deductions were sourced. However, if the property was used predominantly in the United States, the entire loss reduces U.S. source income. The basis of property usually means the cost (money plus the fair market value of other property or services) of property you acquire. Depreciation is an amount deducted to recover the cost or other basis of a trade or business asset. The amount you can deduct depends on the property's cost, when you began using the property, how long it will take to recover your cost, and which depreciation method you use. A depreciation deduction is any deduction for depreciation or amortization or any other allowable deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense.",
        "Intangible property includes patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other like property. The gain from the sale of amortizable or depreciable intangible property, up to the previously allowable amortization or depreciation deductions, is sourced in the same way as the original deductions were sourced. This is the same as the source rule for gain from the sale of depreciable property. See Depreciable property, earlier, for details on how to apply this rule. Gain in excess of the amortization or depreciation deductions is sourced in the country where the property is used if the income from the sale is contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of that property. If the income is not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the income is sourced according to your tax home (discussed earlier). If payments for goodwill do not depend on its productivity, use, or disposition, their source is the country in which the goodwill was generated.",

However, this rule does not apply to sales of inventory property for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if your office or other fixed place of business outside the United States materially participated in the sale. If you have a tax home in the United States but maintain an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States, income from sales of personal property, other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangibles, that is attributable to that foreign office or place of business may be treated as U.S. source income. The income is treated as U.S. source income if an income tax of less than 10% of the income from the sale is paid to a foreign country. This rule also applies to losses if the foreign country would have imposed an income tax of less than 10% had the sale resulted in a gain.",

Interest paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership on deposits or withdrawable accounts with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under federal or state law if the interest paid or credited can be deducted by the association. 3. Interest on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, but only if the branch is in the commercial banking business.",
        "In most cases, dividend income received from domestic corporations is U.S. source income. Dividend income from foreign corporations is usually foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed later. A substitute dividend payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as a distribution on the transferred security.",
        "A payment of a dividend equivalent amount includes any gross amount that references a U.S. source dividend and that is used to compute any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under a contract, if the taxpayer is the long party under the contract. As a result, a taxpayer may be treated as having received a dividend equivalent payment even if the taxpayer makes a net payment or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero. In 2024, an NPC or ELI will generally be a specified NPC or specified ELI, respectively, if the contract is a delta one transaction. Generally, delta is the ratio of change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the stock referenced by the contract. Generally, the amount of a dividend equivalent for a specified NPC or specified ELI is the per share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares of stock referenced by the contract multiplied by the delta of the contract. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Regulations section 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or its successors) for additional information.",

If you are an employee and receive compensation for labor or personal services performed both inside and outside the United States, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (other than certain fringe benefits) is sourced on a time basis. Certain fringe benefits (such as housing and education) are sourced on a geographical basis. Or, you may be permitted to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See Alternative Basis, later.",
        "Certain companies selling products through a multilevel marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor, who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, are entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multilevel marketing companies to independent (nonemployee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor are performed and may, depending on the facts, be considered multiyear compensation, with the source of income determined over the period to which such compensation is attributable.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of compensation for labor or personal services from self-employment on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of your particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will call for an apportionment on a time basis, as explained next.",
        "The source of multiyear compensation is generally determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation is attributable. Multiyear compensation is compensation that is included in your income in 1 tax year but that is attributable to a period that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period to which the compensation is attributable based on the facts and circumstances of your case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entire multiyear period. The amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multiyear compensation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in connection with the project.",

Your principal place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This could be your office, plant, store, shop, or other location. If there is no one place where you spend most of your working time, your main job location is the place where your work is centered, such as where you report for work or are otherwise required to \u201cbase\u201d your work. If you have more than one job at any time, your main job location depends on the facts in each case.

However, the source is determined based on the location of your former principal place of work if you provide sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of your case. Sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for moving expenses that you incur to return to your former principal place of work regardless of whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, your return move to your former principal place of work.",

There are two ways to pay as you go. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your pay. Tax may also be withheld from certain other income\u2014including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling winnings. In each case, the amount withheld is paid to the U.S. Treasury in your name. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. People who are in business for themselves will generally have to pay their tax this way. You may have to pay estimated tax if you receive income such as dividends, interest, rent, and royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax as well.",

If you are a resident alien and you receive income other than wages (such as dividends and royalties) from sources within the United States, file Form W-9 or similar statement with the withholding agent (generally, the payer of the income) so the agent will not withhold tax on the income at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you receive this type of income as a nonresident alien, file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent so that the agent will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. However, if the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, file Form W-8ECI instead.",

Your partnership may be able to reduce withholding on your share of ECTI by considering certain partner-level deductions. Generally, you must submit Form 8804-C for this purpose. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8804-C. The withholding rate on your share of effectively connected income is generally the highest rate of tax specified under section 1 (37%).

The rules for withholding and paying over this amount are similar to the rules for sales of U.S. real property interests. You will receive a Form 8288-A reflecting the amount withheld that you may then claim on line 25f of your Form 1040-NR as a credit against the tax you owe on the gain. You may be able to provide certain information to the transferee to reduce or eliminate withholding. For example, if a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies to all of the gain realized on a transfer, the transferee does not need to withhold if you provide a notice describing the application of a nonrecognition provision. If you are a transferee that failed to withhold, under section 1446(f)(4), the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to you an amount equal to the tax you failed to withhold (plus interest, if applicable). On November 30, 2020, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued final regulations under section 1446(f) in T.D. 9926 (85 FR 76910) for transfers of both non-PTP and PTP interests. The final regulations require any transferee to withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest (other than certain PTP interests) under section 1446(f)(1), unless an exception to withholding applies. These regulations generally apply to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021. However, in accordance with Notice 2021-51, 2021-36 I.R.B. 361, the rules related to withholding under section 1446(f)(4) and to transfers of PTP interests apply to transfers occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, the final regulations revised certain provisions in Regulations section 1.1446-4 for withholding under section 1446(a) on PTP distributions. Also in accordance with Notice 2021-51, these revisions apply to PTP distributions made on or after January 1, 2023. Notices 2018-8 and 2018-29 apply to transfers that occur before the effective date of the final regulations or, as previously described, taxpayers may apply the proposed regulations to transfers of non-PTP interests during this time.

        "All three types of losses refer to federally declared disasters, but the requirements for each loss vary. A federally declared disaster is a disaster determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the federal government under the Stafford Act. A federally declared disaster includes (a) a major disaster declaration, or (b) an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act.",
        "A federal casualty loss is an individual\u2019s casualty or theft loss of personal-use property that is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The casualty loss must occur in a state receiving a federal disaster declaration. If you suffered a federal casualty loss, you are eligible to claim a casualty loss deduction. If you suffered a casualty or theft loss of personal-use property that wasn\u2019t attributable to a federally declared disaster, it isn\u2019t a federal casualty loss, and you may not claim a casualty loss deduction unless the exception applies. Theft losses incurred in a transaction entered into for profit may still be deductible. See the Caution under Deductible losses , later.",
        "A disaster loss is a loss that is attributable to a federally declared disaster and that occurs in an area eligible for assistance pursuant to the Presidential declaration. The disaster loss must occur in a county eligible for public or individual assistance (or both). Disaster losses aren\u2019t limited to individual personal-use property and may be claimed for individual business or income-producing property and by corporations, S corporations, and partnerships. If you suffered a disaster loss, you are eligible to claim a casualty loss deduction and to elect to claim the loss in the preceding tax year. See Disaster Area Losses, later.",
        "A qualified disaster loss includes an individual's casualty and theft loss of personal-use property that is attributable to: A major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Stafford Act in 2016; Hurricane Harvey; Tropical Storm Harvey; Hurricane Irma; Hurricane Maria; The California wildfires in 2017 and January 2018; A major disaster that was declared by the President under section 401 of the Stafford Act and that occurred in 2018 and before December 21, 2019, and continued no later than January 19, 2020 (except those attributable to the California wildfires in January 2018 that received prior relief); and A major disaster that was declared by the President during the period between January 1, 2020, and February 10, 2025. Also, this disaster must have an incident period that began on or after December 28, 2019, and on or before December 12, 2024, and must have ended no later than January 11, 2025.",
        "For tax years 2018 through 2025, if you are an individual, casualty losses of personal-use property are deductible only if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster (federal casualty loss). Personal-use property is other than business property or income-producing property. If the event causing you to suffer a personal casualty loss (not attributed to a federally declared disaster) occurred before January 1, 2018, but the casualty loss wasn\u2019t sustained until January 1, 2018, or later, the casualty loss isn\u2019t deductible.

        "Loss of property due to progressive deterioration isn\u2019t deductible as a casualty loss. This is because the damage results from a steadily operating cause or a normal process, rather than from a sudden event. The following are examples of damage due to progressive deterioration. The steady weakening of a building due to normal wind and weather conditions. The deterioration and damage to a water heater that bursts. However, the rust and water damage to rugs and drapes caused by the bursting of a water heater does qualify as a casualty. Most losses of property caused by droughts. To be deductible, a drought-related loss must generally be incurred in a trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit. Termite or moth damage. The damage or destruction of trees, shrubs, or other plants by a fungus, disease, insects, worms, or similar pests. However, a sudden destruction due to an unexpected or unusual infestation of beetles or other insects may result in a casualty loss.",
        "Because the personal casualty losses claimed under this special procedure aren\u2019t attributable to a federally declared disaster, they\u2019re only deductible to the extent such losses don\u2019t exceed your personal casualty gains.. If you suffered property losses due to the effects of certain imported drywall installed in homes between 2001 and 2009, under a special procedure, you can deduct the amounts you paid to repair damage to your home and household appliances due to corrosive drywall. Under this procedure, you treat the amounts paid for repairs as a casualty loss in the year of payment. For example, amounts you paid for repairs in 2024 are deductible on your 2024 tax return and amounts you paid for repairs in 2023 are deductible on your 2023 tax return.",

This means, for example, that you must establish that the damage, destruction, or loss of property resulted from an identifiable event as defined earlier under Casualty. Furthermore, you must have proof that shows the following. The loss is properly deductible in the tax year you claimed it and not in some other year. See When To Report Gains and Losses , later. The amount of the claimed loss. See Proof of Loss , later. No claim for reimbursement of any portion of the loss exists for which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery.

Partnerships and S corporations should see Form 4684 to find out where to report these gains and losses.",
        "If the damaged or stolen property was depreciable property held more than 1 year, you may have to treat all or part of the gain as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation allowed or allowable. You figure the ordinary income part of the gain in Part III of Form 4797. See Depreciation Recapture in chapter 3 of Pub. 544 for more information about the recapture rule.",
        "If you have a casualty or theft loss, you must decrease your basis in the property by any insurance or other reimbursement you receive and by any deductible loss. The result is your adjusted basis in the property. If you make either of the basis adjustments described above, amounts you spend on repairs that restore the property to its pre-casualty condition increase your adjusted basis. Don\u2019t increase your basis in the property by any qualified disaster mitigation payments (discussed earlier under Disaster Area Losses). See Adjusted Basis in Pub. 551 for more information on adjustments to basis.",
        "If your casualty or theft loss deduction causes your deductions for the year to be more than your income for the year, you may have a net operating loss (NOL). Generally, you can use an NOL to lower your tax in a later year. You don\u2019t have to be in business to have an NOL from a casualty or theft loss.

        "You can\u2019t deduct as a theft loss the decline in market value of stock acquired on the open market for investment if the decline is caused by disclosure of accounting fraud or other illegal misconduct by the officers or directors of the corporation that issued the stock. However, you may be able to deduct it as a capital loss on Schedule D (Form 1040) if the stock is sold or exchanged or becomes completely worthless. For more information about stock sales, worthless stock, and capital losses, see chapter 4 of Pub. 550.",

The choice is generally made on the return you file for that year and applies to all your losses on deposits for the year in that particular financial institution. If you treat the loss as a casualty loss, you can\u2019t treat the same amount of the loss as a nonbusiness bad debt when it actually becomes worthless. However, you can take a nonbusiness bad debt deduction for any amount of loss that is more than the estimated amount you deducted as a casualty or ordinary loss. Once you make the choice, you can\u2019t change it without permission from the IRS.",

That you were the owner of the property, or if you leased the property from someone else, that you were contractually liable to the owner for the damage. The type of casualty (car accident, fire, storm, etc.) and when it occurred. That the loss was a direct result of the casualty.

If you have a gain, you may have to pay tax on it, or you may be able to postpone reporting the gain. See Figuring a Gain, later.",
        "There are two ways you can deduct a casualty or theft loss of inventory, including items you hold for sale to customers. One way is to deduct the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold by properly reporting your opening and closing inventories. Don\u2019t claim this loss again as a casualty or theft loss. If you take the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold, include any insurance or other reimbursement you receive for the loss in gross income. The other way is to deduct the loss separately. If you deduct it separately, eliminate the affected inventory items from the cost of goods sold by making a downward adjustment to opening inventory or purchases. Reduce the loss by the reimbursement you received. Don\u2019t include the reimbursement in gross income. If you don\u2019t receive the reimbursement by the end of the year, you may not claim a loss to the extent you have a reasonable prospect of recovery.",
        "If you are liable for casualty damage to property you lease, your loss is the amount you must pay to repair the property minus any insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive.",
        "Generally, if a single casualty or theft involves more than one item of property, you must figure the loss on each item separately. Then combine the losses to determine the total loss from that casualty or theft.",
        "FMV is the price for which you could sell your property to a willing buyer when neither of you has to sell or buy and both of you know all the relevant facts. The decrease in FMV used to figure the amount of a casualty or theft loss is the difference between the property\u2019s FMV immediately before and immediately after the casualty or theft.",
        "The FMV of property immediately after a theft is considered to be zero because you no longer have the property.",
        "Recovered stolen property is your property that was stolen and later returned to you. If you recovered property after you had already taken a theft loss deduction, you must refigure your loss using the smaller of the property\u2019s adjusted basis (explained later) or the decrease in FMV from the time just before it was stolen until the time it was recovered. Use this amount to refigure your total loss for the year in which the loss was deducted. If your refigured loss is less than the loss you deducted, you generally have to report the difference as income in the recovery year. But report the difference only up to the amount of the loss that reduced your tax. For more information on the amount to report, see Recoveries in Pub. 525.",

But you can use the cost of cleaning up or of making repairs after a casualty as a measure of the decrease in FMV if you meet all the following conditions. The repairs are actually made. The repairs are necessary to bring the property back to its condition before the casualty. The amount spent for repairs isn\u2019t excessive. The repairs take care of the damage only. The value of the property after the repairs isn\u2019t, due to the repairs, more than the value of the property before the casualty.",
        "The cost of restoring landscaping to its original condition after a casualty may indicate the decrease in FMV. You may be able to measure your loss by what you spend on the following. Removing destroyed or damaged trees and shrubs, minus any salvage you receive. Pruning and other measures taken to preserve damaged trees and shrubs. Replanting necessary to restore the property to its approximate value before the casualty.",
        "Books issued by various automobile organizations that list the manufacturer and the model of your car may be useful in figuring the value of your car. You can use the retail value for your car listed in the book and modify it by such factors as mileage and the condition of your car to determine its value. The prices aren\u2019t official, but they may be useful in determining value and suggesting relative prices for comparison with current sales and offerings in your area. If your car isn\u2019t listed in the books, determine its value from other sources. A dealer\u2019s offer for your car as a trade-in on a new car isn\u2019t usually a measure of its true value.",

        "Under the disaster loan appraisal safe harbor method, you may use an appraisal prepared to obtain a loan of federal funds or a loan guarantee from the federal government that identifies your estimated loss from a federally declared disaster to determine the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property.",
        "Personal belongings generally include items of tangible personal property owned by an individual who suffered a casualty or theft loss if they aren\u2019t used in a trade or business. Personal belongings don\u2019t include an item that maintains or increases its value over time or certain other types of property. For more details, see Revenue Procedure 2018-08. The safe harbor methods for personal belongings are the de minimis method and the replacement cost safe harbor method for federally declared disasters.",
        "Under the de minimis method, you can make a good-faith estimate of the decrease in the FMV of your personal belongings. You must maintain records describing your affected personal belongings as well as your methodology for estimating your loss. This method is limited to losses of $5,000 or less.",
        "You generally shouldn\u2019t consider the following items when attempting to establish the decrease in FMV of your property.",
        "The cost of protecting your property against a casualty or theft isn\u2019t part of a casualty or theft loss. The amount you spend on insurance or to board up your house against a storm isn\u2019t part of your loss. If the property is business property, these expenses are deductible as business expenses. If you make permanent improvements to your property to protect it against a casualty or theft, add the cost of these improvements to your basis in the property. An example would be the cost of a dike to prevent flooding.",
        "You can\u2019t increase your basis in the property by, or deduct as a business expense, any expenditures you made with respect to qualified disaster mitigation payments (discussed later under Disaster Area Losses).",
        "The incidental expenses due to a casualty or theft, such as expenses for the treatment of personal injuries, for temporary housing, or for a rental car, aren\u2019t part of your casualty or theft loss. However, they may be deductible as business expenses if the damaged or stolen property is business property.",
        "The cost of replacing stolen or destroyed property isn\u2019t part of a casualty or theft loss.",
        "Don\u2019t consider sentimental value when determining your loss. If a family portrait, heirloom, or keepsake is damaged, destroyed, or stolen, you must base your loss on its FMV, as limited by your adjusted basis in the property.",
        "A decrease in the value of your property because it is in or near an area that suffered a casualty, or that might again suffer a casualty, isn\u2019t to be taken into consideration. You have a loss only for actual casualty damage to your property. However, if your home is in a federally declared disaster area, see Disaster Area Losses, later.",
        "Photographs taken after a casualty will be helpful in establishing the condition and value of the property after it was damaged. Photographs showing the condition of the property after it was repaired, restored, or replaced may also be helpful. Appraisals are used to figure the decrease in FMV because of a casualty or theft. See Appraisal, earlier, under Figuring Decrease in FMV\u2014Items To Consider for information about appraisals. The costs of photographs and appraisals used as evidence of the value and condition of property damaged as a result of a casualty aren\u2019t a part of the loss. They are expenses in determining your tax liability. For tax years 2018 through 2025, they can no longer be deducted as miscellaneous itemized deductions.",
        "The measure of your investment in the property you own is its basis. For property you buy, your basis is usually its cost to you. For property you acquire in some other way, such as inheriting it, receiving it as a gift, or getting it in a nontaxable exchange, you must figure your basis in another way, as explained in Pub. 551.",
        "If you inherited property from someone who died in 2010 and the executor of the decedent\u2019s estate made a section 1022 election using Form 8939, Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent, special rules regarding the basis would apply. An executor of an estate of a decedent who died in 2010 could elect to apply a modified carryover basis treatment to property acquired from the decedent. For more detailed information about the Section 1022 Election, see Notice 2011-66, 2011-35 I.R.B. 184, available at IRS.gov/irb/2011-35IRB#NOT-2011-66.

        "While you own the property, various events may take place that change your basis. Some events, such as additions or permanent improvements to the property, increase basis. Others, such as earlier casualty losses and depreciation deductions, decrease basis. When you add the increases to the basis and subtract the decreases from the basis, the result is your adjusted basis. See Pub. 551 for more information on figuring the basis of your property.",
        "After you have figured the amount of your casualty or theft loss, you must figure how much of the loss you can deduct. The deduction for casualty and theft losses of personal-use property is limited. For tax years 2018 through 2025, personal casualty and theft losses of an individual are deductible only to the extent they\u2019re attributable to a federally declared disaster. Personal casualty and theft losses attributable to a federally declared disaster are subject to the $100 per casualty and 10% rules, discussed later. The $100 and 10% rules are also summarized in Table 2. An exception to the rule above, limiting the personal casualty and theft loss deduction to losses attributable to a federally declared disaster, applies if you have personal casualty gains for the tax year. In this case, you may reduce your personal casualty gains by any casualty losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster. Any excess gain is used to reduce losses from a federally declared disaster. The 10% rule is applied to any federal disaster losses that remain. Losses on business property and income-producing property aren\u2019t subject to these rules. However, if your casualty or theft loss involved a home you used for business or rented out, your deductible loss may be limited. See the instructions for Form 4684, Section B. If the casualty or theft loss involved property used in a passive activity, see Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, and its instructions.",
        "After you have figured your casualty or theft loss on personal-use property, as discussed earlier, you must reduce that loss by $100. This reduction applies to each total casualty or theft loss, including those losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster that are applied to reduce your personal casualty gains. It doesn\u2019t matter how many pieces of property are involved in an event. Only a single $100 reduction applies.",
        "Generally, events closely related in origin cause a single casualty. It is a single casualty when the damage is from two or more closely related causes, such as wind and flood damage caused by the same storm. A single casualty may also damage two or more pieces of property, such as a tornado that damages both your home and your car parked in your driveway.",
        "If you and your spouse file a joint return, you are treated as one individual in applying the $100 rule. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you own the property jointly or separately. If you and your spouse have a casualty or theft loss and you file separate returns, each of you must reduce your loss by $100. This is true even if you own the property jointly. If one spouse owns the property, only that spouse can claim a loss deduction on a separate return. If the casualty or theft loss is on property you own as tenants by the entirety, each of you can figure your deduction on only one-half of the loss on separate returns. Neither of you can figure your deduction on the entire loss on a separate return. Each of you must reduce the loss by $100.",
        "If two or more individuals (other than spouses filing a joint return) have a loss on property jointly owned, the $100 rule applies separately to each. For example, if two sisters live together in a home they own jointly and they have a casualty loss on the home, the $100 rule applies separately to each sister.",
        "If you and your spouse file a joint return, you are treated as one individual in applying the 10% rule. It doesn\u2019t matter if you own the property jointly or separately. If you file separate returns, the 10% rule applies to each return on which a loss is claimed.",
        "If two or more individuals (other than spouses filing a joint return) have a loss on property that is owned jointly, the 10% rule applies separately to each.",
        "If you have casualty or theft gains as well as losses to your personal-use property, you must compare your total gains to your total losses. Do this after you have reduced each loss by any reimbursements and by $100 but before you have reduced the federal casualty losses by 10% of your AGI. Casualty or theft gains don\u2019t include gains you choose to postpone. SeePostponement of Gain , later..",
        "If your losses are more than your recognized gains, subtract your gains from your losses and reduce the result by 10% of your AGI. The rest, if any, is your deductible loss from personal-use property. If you have losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster, see Line 14 in the Instructions for Form 4684. Losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster can be used only to offset gains. If you have qualified disaster losses, see Line 15 in the Instructions for Form 4684 for more details.",
        "If your recognized gains are more than your losses, subtract your losses from your gains. The difference is treated as a capital gain and must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040). The 10% rule doesn\u2019t apply to your gains. If you have losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster, see Line 14 in the Instructions for Form 4684.",
        "Generally, you must figure your loss separately for each item stolen, damaged, or destroyed. However, a special rule applies to real property you own for personal use.",
        "In figuring a loss to real estate you own for personal use, all improvements (such as buildings and ornamental trees and the land containing the improvements) are considered together.",
        "Personal property is any property that isn\u2019t real property. If your personal property is stolen or is damaged or destroyed by a casualty, you must figure your loss separately for each item of property. Then combine these separate losses to figure the total loss. Reduce the total loss by $100 and 10% of your AGI to figure the loss deduction.",
        "When a casualty involves both real and personal properties, you must figure the loss separately for each type of property. However, you apply a single $100 reduction to the total loss. Then, you apply the 10% rule to figure the casualty loss deduction.",
        "When property is used partly for personal purposes and partly for business or income-producing purposes, the casualty or theft loss deduction must be figured separately for the personal-use portion and for the business or income-producing portion. You must figure each loss separately because the losses attributed to these two uses are figured in two different ways. When figuring each loss, allocate the total cost or basis, the FMV before and after the casualty or theft loss, and the insurance or other reimbursement between the business and personal use of the property. The $100 rule and the 10% rule apply only to the casualty or theft loss on the personal-use portion of the property.",
        "Even if the decrease in FMV of your property is smaller than the adjusted basis of your property, use your adjusted basis to figure the gain.",
        "The amount you receive includes any money plus the value of any property you receive minus any expenses you incur in obtaining reimbursement. It also includes any reimbursement used to pay off a mortgage or other lien on the damaged, destroyed, or stolen property.",
        "If you have a gain because your main home was destroyed, you can generally exclude the gain from your income as if you had sold or exchanged your home. You may be able to exclude up to $250,000 of the gain (up to $500,000 if married filing jointly). To exclude a gain, you must generally have owned and lived in the property as your main home for at least 2 years during the 5-year period ending on the date it was destroyed. For information on this exclusion, see Pub. 523. If your gain is more than the amount you can exclude, but you buy replacement property, you may be able to postpone reporting the excess gain. See Postponement of Gain, later.",
        "You must generally report your gain as income in the year you receive the reimbursement. However, you don\u2019t have to report your gain if you meet certain requirements and choose to postpone reporting the gain according to the rules explained under Postponement of Gain next. For information on how to report a gain, see How To Report Gains and Losses, later. If you have a casualty or theft gain on personal-use property that you choose to postpone reporting (as explained next) and you also have another casualty or theft loss on personal-use property, don\u2019t consider the gain you are postponing when figuring your casualty or theft loss deduction. See10% Rule under Deduction Limits, earlier..",
        "Don\u2019t report a gain if you receive reimbursement in the form of property similar or related in service or use to the destroyed or stolen property. Your basis in the new property is generally the same as your adjusted basis in the property it replaces. You must ordinarily report the gain on your stolen or destroyed property if you receive money or unlike property as reimbursement. However, you can choose to postpone reporting the gain if you purchase property that is similar or related in service or use to the stolen or destroyed property within a specified replacement period, discussed later. You can also choose to postpone reporting the gain if you purchase a controlling interest (at least 80%) in a corporation owning property that is similar or related in service or use to the property. See Controlling interest in a corporation, later. If you have a gain on damaged property, you can postpone reporting the gain if you spend the reimbursement to restore the property. To postpone reporting all the gain, the cost of your replacement property must be at least as much as the reimbursement you receive. If the cost of the replacement property is less than the reimbursement, you must include the gain in your income up to the amount of the unspent reimbursement.",
        "For casualties and thefts described in (3) above, gains can\u2019t be offset by any losses when determining whether the total gain is more than $100,000. If the property is owned by a partnership, the $100,000 limit applies to the partnership and each partner. If the property is owned by an S corporation, the $100,000 limit applies to the S corporation and each shareholder.",
        "This rule doesn\u2019t apply if the related person acquired the property from an unrelated person within the period of time allowed for replacing the destroyed or stolen property.",
        "If a taxpayer dies after having a gain but before buying replacement property, the gain must be reported for the year in which the decedent realized the gain. The executor of the estate or the person succeeding to the funds from the casualty or theft can\u2019t postpone reporting the gain by buying replacement property.",
        "You must buy replacement property for the specific purpose of replacing your destroyed or stolen property. Property you acquire as a gift or inheritance doesn\u2019t qualify. You don\u2019t have to use the same funds you receive as reimbursement for your old property to acquire the replacement property. If you spend the money you receive from the insurance company for other purposes, and borrow money to buy replacement property, you can still postpone reporting the gain if you meet the other requirements.",
        "If you pay a contractor in advance to replace your destroyed or stolen property, you aren\u2019t considered to have bought replacement property unless it is finished before the end of the replacement period. See Replacement Period, later.",

To postpone reporting all the excess gain, the replacement property must cost at least as much as the amount you received because of the destruction minus the excluded gain. Also, if you postpone reporting any part of your gain under these rules, you are treated as having owned and used the replacement property as your main home for the period you owned and used the destroyed property as your main home.",
        "You must reduce the basis of your replacement property (its cost) by the amount of postponed gain. In this way, tax on the gain is postponed until you dispose of the replacement property.",

        "Standing timber (not land) you bought with the proceeds from the sale of timber downed by a casualty (such as high winds, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions) qualifies as replacement property. If you bought the standing timber within the specified replacement period, you can postpone reporting the gain.",

You decide this by determining all of the following. Whether the properties are of similar service to you. The nature of the business risks connected with the properties. What the properties demand of you in the way of management, service, and relations to your tenants.",
        "If your destroyed business or income-producing property was located in a federally declared disaster area, any tangible replacement property you acquire for use in any business is treated as similar or related in service or use to the destroyed property. The replacement property doesn\u2019t have to be located in the federally declared disaster area. For more information, see Disaster Area Losses, later.",
        "You can replace property by acquiring a controlling interest in a corporation that owns property similar or related in service or use to your damaged, destroyed, or stolen property. You can postpone reporting your entire gain if the cost of the stock that gives you a controlling interest is at least as much as the amount received (reimbursement) for your property. You have a controlling interest if you own stock having at least 80% of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock.",
        "If two or more properties fall in the same class, allocate the reduction to each property in proportion to the adjusted bases of all the properties in that class. The reduced basis of any single property can\u2019t be less than zero.",
        "To postpone reporting your gain, you must buy replacement property within a specified period of time. This is the replacement period. The replacement period begins on the date your property was damaged, destroyed, or stolen. The replacement period generally ends 2 years after the close of the first tax year in which any part of your gain is realized.",

        "You postpone reporting your gain from a casualty or theft by reporting your choice on your tax return for the year you have the gain. You have the gain in the year you receive insurance proceeds or other reimbursements that result in a gain. If a partnership or a corporation owns the stolen or destroyed property, only the partnership or corporation can choose to postpone reporting the gain.",

The replacement property. The postponed gain. The basis adjustment that reflects the postponed gain. Any gain you are reporting as income.",
        "If you intend to acquire replacement property after you file your return for the year in which you have the gain, your statement should also state that you are choosing to replace the property within the required replacement period. You should then attach another statement to your return for the year in which you acquire the replacement property. This statement should contain detailed information on the replacement property. If you acquire part of your replacement property in one year and part in another year, you must make a statement for each year. The statement should contain detailed information on the replacement property acquired in that year.",
        "Once you have acquired qualified replacement property that you designate as replacement property in a statement attached to your tax return, you can\u2019t later substitute other qualified replacement property. This is true even if you acquire the other property within the replacement period. However, if you discover that the original replacement property wasn\u2019t qualified replacement property, you can (within the replacement period) substitute the new qualified replacement property.",

You don\u2019t acquire replacement property within the required replacement period plus extensions. On this amended return, you must report the gain and pay any additional tax due. You acquire replacement property within the required replacement period plus extensions, but at a cost less than the amount you receive for the casualty or theft. On this amended return, you must report the portion of the gain that can\u2019t be postponed and pay any additional tax due.",

        "If you receive an insurance or other reimbursement that is more than your adjusted basis in the destroyed or stolen property, you have a gain from the casualty or theft. You must include this gain in your income in the year you receive the reimbursement, unless you choose to postpone reporting the gain, as explained earlier.",
        "Generally, you can deduct a casualty loss that isn\u2019t reimbursable only in the tax year in which the casualty occurred. This is true even if you don\u2019t repair or replace the damaged property until a later year. (However, see Disaster Area Losses, later, for an exception.) You can deduct theft losses that aren\u2019t reimbursable only in the year you discover your property was stolen. If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, the loss isn\u2019t sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be received. If you aren\u2019t sure whether part of your casualty or theft loss will be reimbursed, don\u2019t deduct that part until the tax year when you become reasonably certain that it won\u2019t be reimbursed.

It also lists Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) phone numbers. (See Contacting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\"), later.) A disaster loss is a loss that occurred in an area determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the federal government under the Stafford Act and that is attributable to a federally declared disaster. Disaster areas include areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both). A federally declared disaster includes a major disaster or emergency declaration. A list of the areas warranting public or individual assistance (or both) under the Stafford Act is available atFEMA.gov/Disaster ..",

        "You should adjust your deductions on Form 1040-X. The Instructions for Form 1040-X show how to do this. Explain the reasons for your adjustment and attach Form 4684 to show how you figured your loss. See Figuring a Loss, earlier. If the damaged or destroyed property was nonbusiness property and you didn\u2019t itemize your deductions on your original return, you must first determine whether the casualty loss deduction now makes it advantageous for you to itemize. It is advantageous to itemize if the total of the casualty loss deduction and any other itemized deductions is more than your standard deduction. If you itemize, attach Schedule A (Form 1040) or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR), and Form 4684 to your amended return. Fill out Form 1040-X to refigure your tax to find your refund.",
        "You should keep the records that support your loss deduction. You don\u2019t have to attach them to the amended return. If your records were destroyed or lost, you may have to reconstruct them.

If you had your tax return completed by a tax preparer, he or she should be able to provide you with a copy of your return. If not, you can get a copy by filing Form 4506 with the IRS. There is a fee for each return requested. However, if your main home, principal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared disaster area, this fee will be waived. Write the name of the disaster in the top margin of Form 4506 (for example, \u201cTennessee Tropical Storm Helene\u201d).",
        "If your inventory loss qualifies as a casualty loss and is attributable to a federally declared disaster in an area designated by FEMA for public or individual assistance (or both), you may elect to deduct the loss on your return or amended return for the immediately preceding year. However, decrease your opening inventory for the year of the loss so that the loss won\u2019t be reported again in inventories.",
        "If part of your federal disaster loan was canceled under the Stafford Act, it is considered to be reimbursement for the loss. The cancellation reduces your casualty loss deduction.",
        "Don\u2019t include post-disaster relief grants received under the Stafford Act in your income if the grant payments are made to help you meet necessary expenses or serious needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, or funeral expenses. Don\u2019t deduct casualty losses or medical expenses to the extent they are specifically reimbursed by these disaster relief grants. If the casualty loss was specifically reimbursed by the grant and you received the grant after the year in which you deducted the casualty loss, see Reimbursement Received After Deducting Loss, earlier. Unemployment assistance payments under the Stafford Act are taxable unemployment compensation.",
