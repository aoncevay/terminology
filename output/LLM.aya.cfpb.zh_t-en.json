When you figure how much income tax you want withheld from your pay and when you figure your estimated tax, consider tax law changes effective in 2025. For more information, see Pub. 505. Alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount increased. The AMT exemption amount is increased to $85,700 ($133,300 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse; $66,650 if married filing separately). The income levels at which the AMT exemption begins to phase out have increased to $609,350 ($1,218,700 if married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse). New reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP) changed the reporting requirements for third-party settlement organizations. Beginning in 2024, there are lower reporting thresholds for Form 1099-K. See chapter 8, later. Updated reporting requirements for Form 1099-K. For 2024, payment card companies, payment apps, and online marketplaces will be required to send you a Form 1099-K when the amount of your business transactions during the year is more than $5,000. In calendar year 2025, the threshold will lower to more than $2,500; and for 2026 and later years, the threshold will be more than $600. Changes to reporting amounts from Form 1099-K. Beginning in 2024, if you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error or for personal items sold at a loss, you will now enter these amounts in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1 (Form 1040).",

Second, we use information from outside sources that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals. If we determine that the information is accurate and reliable, we may use it to select a return for examination.

Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax. For more information on determining whether you are an employee or independent contractor, see Pub. 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide.",
        "If you and your spouse jointly own and operate an unincorporated business and share in the profits and losses, you are partners in a partnership, whether or not you have a formal partnership agreement. Do not use Schedule C. Instead, file Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income. For more information, see Pub. 541, Partnerships. Exception—Community income. If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship or a partnership. States with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. A change in your reporting position will be treated as a conversion of the entity. See Pub. 555 for more information about community property laws. Exception—Qualified joint venture (QJV). If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership for the tax year. Making this election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065 but still give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based. For an explanation of \"material participation,\" see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. Only businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a QJV.. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. Each of you must file a separate Schedule C and a separate Schedule SE. For more information, see Qualified Joint Ventures in the Instructions for Schedule SE.",

These programs may be based on information returns, such as Forms 1099 and W-2; on studies of past examinations; or on certain issues identified by other special projects. Another way is to use information from compliance projects that indicates that a return may have incorrect amounts. These sources may include newspapers, public records, and individuals.

You don’t have to charge off and deduct your partly worthless debts annually. You can delay the charge-off until a later year. However, you can’t deduct any part of a debt after the year it becomes totally worthless. There are two rules regarding charge-off debts to consider: Significantly modified debt. An exception to the charge-off rule exists for debt that has been significantly modified and on which the holder recognized gain. For more information, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3) Deduction disallowed. Generally, you can claim a partial bad debt deduction only in the year you make the charge-off on your books. If, under audit, the IRS doesn’t allow your deduction and the debt becomes partly worthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the amount you charged off in that year plus the disallowed amount charged off in the earlier year. The charge-off in the earlier year, unless reversed on your books, fulfills the charge-off requirement for the later year.",

You don’t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don’t and the IRS later rules the debt is only partly worthless, you will not be allowed a deduction for the debt in that tax year because a deduction of a partly worthless bad debt is limited to the amount actually charged off.

Either spouse can revoke the choice for any tax year, provided they make the revocation by the due date for filing the tax return for that tax year.

If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return, but does file a return (for example, to obtain a refund), attach the statement to the return. 3. If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return and does not file a claim for refund, send the statement to the Internal Revenue Service Center where you filed the last joint return. 2. Death. The death of either spouse ends the choice, beginning with the first tax year following the year the spouse died. However, if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident and is entitled to the joint tax rates as a surviving spouse, the choice will not end until the close of the last year for which these joint rates may be used. If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice ends on the first day after the close of the tax year in which the spouses died. 3. Legal separation. A legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance ends the choice as of the beginning of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs. 4. Inadequate records. The IRS can end the choice for any tax year that either spouse has failed to keep adequate books, records, and other information necessary to determine the correct income tax liability, or to provide adequate access to those records.",

For example, income from the sale of inventory in the United States is U.S. source income, whether you purchased it in the United States or in a foreign country. Income from the sale of inventory property that you produced in the United States and sold outside the United States (or vice versa) is sourced where the property is produced.

The rest of this part of the gain is considered to be from sources outside the United States. For this purpose, “U.S. depreciation adjustments” are the depreciation adjustments to the basis of the property that are allowable in figuring taxable income from U.S. sources. However, if the property is used predominantly in the United States during a tax year, all depreciation deductions allowable for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation adjustments. But there are some exceptions for certain transportation, communications, and other property used internationally. Gain from the sale of depreciable property that is more than the total depreciation adjustments on the property is sourced as if the property were inventory property, as discussed above. A loss is sourced in the same way as the depreciation deductions were sourced. However, if the property was used predominantly in the United States, the entire loss reduces U.S. source income. The basis of property usually means the cost (money plus the fair market value of other property or services) of property you acquire. Depreciation is an amount deducted to recover the cost or other basis of a trade or business asset. The amount you can deduct depends on the property's cost, when you began using the property, how long it will take to recover your cost, and which depreciation method you use. A depreciation deduction is any deduction for depreciation or amortization or any other allowable deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense.",
        "Intangible property includes patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other like property. The gain from the sale of amortizable or depreciable intangible property, up to the previously allowable amortization or depreciation deductions, is sourced in the same way as the original deductions were sourced. This is the same as the source rule for gain from the sale of depreciable property. See Depreciable property, earlier, for details on how to apply this rule. Gain in excess of the amortization or depreciation deductions is sourced in the country where the property is used if the income from the sale is contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of that property. If the income is not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the income is sourced according to your tax home (discussed earlier). If payments for goodwill do not depend on its productivity, use, or disposition, their source is the country in which the goodwill was generated.",
        "Despite any of the earlier rules, if you do not have a tax home in the United States, but you maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, treat the income from any sale of personal property (including inventory property) that is attributable to that office or place of business as U.S. source income. However, this rule does not apply to sales of inventory property for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if your office or other fixed place of business outside the United States materially participated in the sale. If you have a tax home in the United States but maintain an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States, income from sales of personal property, other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangibles, that is attributable to that foreign office or place of business may be treated as U.S. source income. The income is treated as U.S. source income if an income tax of less than 10% of the income from the sale is paid to a foreign country. This rule also applies to losses if the foreign country would have imposed an income tax of less than 10% had the sale resulted in a gain.",
        "The place or manner of payment is immaterial in determining the source of the income. A substitute interest payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as the interest on the transferred security.",
        "U.S. source interest income does not include the following items. 1. Interest paid by a resident alien or a domestic corporation on obligations issued before August 10, 2010, if for the 3-year period ending with the close of the payer's tax year preceding the interest payment, at least 80% (0.80) of the payer's total gross income: 1. Is from sources outside the United States, and 2. Is attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business by the individual or corporation in a foreign country or a U.S. territory. However, the interest will be considered U.S. source interest income if either of the following applies. 1. The recipient of the interest is related to the resident alien or domestic corporation. See section 954(d)(3) for the definition of “related person.” 2. The terms of the obligation are significantly modified after August 9, 2010. Any extension of the term of the obligation is considered a significant modification. 2. Interest paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership on deposits or withdrawable accounts with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under federal or state law if the interest paid or credited can be deducted by the association. 3. Interest on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, but only if the branch is in the commercial banking business.",
        "In most cases, dividend income received from domestic corporations is U.S. source income. Dividend income from foreign corporations is usually foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed later. A substitute dividend payment made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is sourced in the same manner as a distribution on the transferred security.",
        "A payment of a dividend equivalent amount includes any gross amount that references a U.S. source dividend and that is used to compute any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under a contract, if the taxpayer is the long party under the contract. As a result, a taxpayer may be treated as having received a dividend equivalent payment even if the taxpayer makes a net payment or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero. In 2024, an NPC or ELI will generally be a specified NPC or specified ELI, respectively, if the contract is a delta one transaction. Generally, delta is the ratio of change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the stock referenced by the contract. Generally, the amount of a dividend equivalent for a specified NPC or specified ELI is the per share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares of stock referenced by the contract multiplied by the delta of the contract. Special rules apply to complex contracts. See Regulations section 1.871-15 and Notice 2024-44 (or its successors) for additional information.",
        "All wages and any other compensation for services performed in the United States are considered to be from sources in the United States. The only exceptions to this rule are discussed under Employees of foreign persons, organizations, or offices, later, and under Crew members, earlier. If you are an employee and receive compensation for labor or personal services performed both inside and outside the United States, special rules apply in determining the source of the compensation. Compensation (other than certain fringe benefits) is sourced on a time basis. Certain fringe benefits (such as housing and education) are sourced on a geographical basis. Or, you may be permitted to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See Alternative Basis, later.",
        "Certain companies selling products through a multilevel marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor, who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, are entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multilevel marketing companies to independent (nonemployee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor are performed and may, depending on the facts, be considered multiyear compensation, with the source of income determined over the period to which such compensation is attributable.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of compensation for labor or personal services from self-employment on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of your particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will call for an apportionment on a time basis, as explained next.",
        "The source of multiyear compensation is generally determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation is attributable. Multiyear compensation is compensation that is included in your income in 1 tax year but that is attributable to a period that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period to which the compensation is attributable based on the facts and circumstances of your case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entire multiyear period. The amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multiyear compensation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that you performed labor or personal services in connection with the project.",
        "The above fringe benefits, except for tax reimbursement and hazardous or hardship duty pay, are sourced based on your principal place of work. Your principal place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This could be your office, plant, store, shop, or other location. If there is no one place where you spend most of your working time, your main job location is the place where your work is centered, such as where you report for work or are otherwise required to “base” your work. If you have more than one job at any time, your main job location depends on the facts in each case. The most important factors to be considered are: The total time you spend at each place, The amount of work you do at each place, and How much money you earn at each place.",
        "The source of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of your dependents is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. An education fringe benefit includes payments only for the following expenses for education at an elementary or secondary school. Tuition, fees, academic tutoring, special needs services for a special needs student, books, supplies, and other equipment. Room and board and uniforms that are required or provided by the school in connection with enrollment or attendance.",
        "The source of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of your principal place of work. Your local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that you receive as compensation for local transportation for you or your spouse or dependents at the location of your principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any employer-provided vehicle used predominantly by you, your spouse, or your dependents for local transportation. Actual expenses do not include the cost (including interest) of any vehicle purchased by you or on your behalf.",
        "The source of a moving expense reimbursement is generally based on the location of your new principal place of work. However, the source is determined based on the location of your former principal place of work if you provide sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of your case. Sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement between you and your employer, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will reimburse you for moving expenses that you incur to return to your former principal place of work regardless of whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, your return move to your former principal place of work.",
        "If you are an employee, you can determine the source of your compensation under an alternative basis if you establish to the satisfaction of the IRS that, under the facts and circumstances of your case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation than the time or geographical basis. If you use an alternative basis, you must keep (and have available for inspection) records to document why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of your compensation. Also, if your total compensation from all sources is $250,000 or more, check “Yes” to both questions on line K of Schedule OI (Form 1040-NR), and attach a written statement to your tax return that sets forth all of the following. 1. Your name and SSN (entered across the top of the statement). 2. The specific compensation income, or the specific fringe benefit, for which you are using the alternative basis. 3. For each item in (2), the alternative basis of allocation of source used. 4. For each item in (2), a computation showing how the alternative allocation was computed. 5. A comparison of the dollar amount of the U.S. compensation and foreign compensation sourced under both the alternative basis and the time or geographical basis, discussed earlier.",
        "Transportation income is income from the use of a vessel or aircraft or for the performance of services directly related to the use of any vessel or aircraft. This is true whether the vessel or aircraft is owned, hired, or leased. The term “vessel or aircraft” includes any container used in connection with a vessel or aircraft. All income from transportation that begins and ends in the United States is treated as derived from sources in the United States. If the transportation begins or ends in the United States, 50% of the transportation income is treated as derived from sources in the United States. For transportation income from personal services, 50% of the income is U.S. source income if the transportation is between the United States and a U.S. territory. For nonresident aliens, this only applies to income derived from, or in connection with, an aircraft. For information on how U.S. source transportation income is taxed, see chapter 4.",
        "Generally, the source of scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes, and awards is the residence of the payer regardless of who actually disburses the funds. However, see Activities to be performed outside the United States, later. For example, payments for research or study in the United States made by the United States, a noncorporate U.S. resident, or a domestic corporation are from U.S. sources. Similar payments from a foreign government or foreign corporation are foreign source payments even though the funds may be disbursed through a U.S. agent. Payments made by an entity designated as a public international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act are from foreign sources.",

        "If you receive a pension from a domestic trust for services performed both in and outside the United States, part of the pension payment is from U.S. sources. That part is the amount attributable to earnings of the pension plan and the employer contributions made for services performed in the United States. This applies whether the distribution is made under a qualified or nonqualified stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan (whether or not funded). If you performed services as an employee of the United States, you may receive a distribution from the U.S. Government under a plan, such as the Civil Service Retirement System, that is treated as a qualified pension plan. Your U.S. source income is the otherwise taxable amount of the distribution that is attributable to your total U.S. Government basic pay other than tax-exempt pay for services performed outside the United States.",

Personal services income you receive in a tax year in which you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Income received in a year other than the year you performed the services is also effectively connected if it would have been effectively connected if received in the year you performed the services. Personal services income includes wages, salaries, commissions, fees, per diem allowances, and employee allowances and bonuses. The income may be paid to you in the form of cash, services, or property. If you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business only because you perform personal services in the United States during the tax year, income and gains from assets, and gains and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are generally not effectively connected with your trade or business. However, if there is a direct economic relationship between your holding of the asset and your trade or business of performing personal services, the income, gain, or loss is effectively connected.",
        "If you performed personal services in the United States after 1986, and in a later tax year, you receive pension or retirement distributions attributable to these services when you are a nonresident alien, such distributions are effectively connected income to the extent attributable to contributions. This is true whether or not you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business in the year you receive the pension or retirement distributions.",
        "“Fixed place of business” generally means a place, site, structure, or other similar facility through which you engage in a trade or business. “Regularly scheduled transportation” means that a ship or aircraft follows a published schedule with repeated sailings or flights at regular intervals between the same points for voyages or flights that begin or end in the United States. This definition applies to both scheduled and chartered air transportation. If you do not meet the two conditions above, the income is not effectively connected and is taxed at a 4% rate. See Transportation Tax, later in this chapter.",
        "All profits or losses from U.S. sources that are from the operation of a business in the United States are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. For example, profit from the sale in the United States of inventory property purchased either in this country or in a foreign country is effectively connected trade or business income. A share of U.S. source profits or losses of a partnership that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States is also effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States.",
        "Gains and losses from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests (whether or not they are capital assets) are taxed as if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. You must treat the gain or loss as effectively connected with that trade or business.",

Real property includes the following. 1. Land and unsevered natural products of the land, such as growing crops and timber, and mines, wells, and other natural deposits. 2. Improvements on land, including buildings, other permanent structures, and their structural components. 3. Personal property associated with the use of real property, such as equipment used in farming, mining, forestry, or construction or property used in lodging facilities or rented office space, unless the personal property is: 1. Disposed of more than 1 year before or after the disposition of the real property, or 2. Separately sold to persons unrelated either to the seller or to the buyer of the real property.",

An interest in a foreign corporation owning U.S. real property is generally not a U.S. real property interest unless the corporation chooses to be treated as a domestic corporation.",
        "In most cases, any distribution from a QIE to a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or other QIE that is attributable to the QIE’s gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is treated as gain recognized by the nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or other QIE from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest. Certain exceptions apply to the look-through rule for distributions by QIEs. A distribution by a QIE with respect to stock regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States is not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder owns 5% or less of that stock (or 10% or less of that stock in the case of a REIT) at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution. A distribution made by a REIT is generally not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder is a qualified shareholder (as described in section 897(k)(3)). A distribution that you do not treat as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest may be included in your gross income as a regular dividend.",
        "Dispositions of stock in a REIT that is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a qualified shareholder will not be treated as a U.S. real property interest. See sections 897(k)(2) through (4) for more information.",

A person holding less than 5% of any class of stock of the QIE, which is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States at all times during the testing period, would be treated as a U.S. person unless the QIE has actual knowledge that such person is not a U.S. person. 2. Any stock in a QIE that is held by another QIE will be treated as held by a foreign person if: 1. Any class of stock of such other QIE is regularly traded on an established securities market, or 2. Such other QIE is a RIC that issues certain redeemable securities. Notwithstanding the above, the stock of the QIE will be treated as held by a U.S. person if such other QIE is domestically controlled. 3. Stock in a QIE held by any other QIE not described above will be treated as held by a U.S. person in proportion to the stock of such other QIE that is (or is treated as) held by a U.S. person.",
        "If this occurs, you are treated as having a gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest in an amount equal to the distribution that would have been treated as such gain. This also applies to any substitute dividend payment. A transaction is not treated as an applicable wash sale transaction if: You actually receive the distribution from the domestically controlled QIE related to the interest disposed of, or acquired, in the transaction; or You dispose of any class of stock in a QIE that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States but only if you did not own more than 5% of that class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution.",

        "Income you receive during the tax year that is effectively connected with your trade or business in the United States is, after allowable deductions, taxed at the rates that apply to U.S. citizens and residents. Generally, you can receive effectively connected income only if you are a nonresident alien engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year. However, if you receive payments from the sale or exchange of property, the performance of services, or any other transaction during a tax year in which you are not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, but such payments would have been treated as effectively connected income in the year the transaction took place or you performed the services, then they are treated as effectively connected income in the tax year you received them.",

        "The 30% (or lower treaty) rate applies to the gross amount of U.S. source fixed, determinable, annual, or periodical (FDAP) gains, profits, or income. Income is fixed when it is paid in amounts known ahead of time. Income is determinable whenever there is a basis for figuring the amount to be paid. Income can be periodic if it is paid from time to time. It does not have to be paid annually or at regular intervals. Income can be determinable or periodic even if the length of time during which the payments are made is increased or decreased. Items specifically included as fixed or determinable income are interest (other than OID), dividends, dividend equivalent payments (defined in chapter 2), rents, premiums, annuities, salaries, wages, and other compensation. A substitute dividend or interest payment received under a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction is treated the same as the amounts received on the transferred security. Other items of income, such as royalties, may also be subject to the 30% tax. Some fixed or determinable income may be exempt from U.S. tax.

However, no tax is imposed on nonbusiness gambling income a nonresident alien wins playing blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, or big-6 wheel in the United States. Nonresident aliens are taxed at graduated rates on net gambling income won in the United States that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.

        "This chapter discusses how to pay your U.S. income tax as you earn or receive income during the year. In general, the federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. There are two ways to pay as you go. 1. Withholding. If you are an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your pay. Tax may also be withheld from certain other income—including pensions, bonuses, commissions, and gambling winnings. In each case, the amount withheld is paid to the U.S. Treasury in your name. 2. Estimated tax. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. People who are in business for themselves will generally have to pay their tax this way. You may have to pay estimated tax if you receive income such as dividends, interest, rent, and royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax, but self-employment tax and alternative minimum tax as well.",

If you are a resident alien and you receive income other than wages (such as dividends and royalties) from sources within the United States, file Form W-9 or similar statement with the withholding agent (generally, the payer of the income) so the agent will not withhold tax on the income at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. If you receive this type of income as a nonresident alien, file Form W-8BEN with the withholding agent so that the agent will withhold tax at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate. However, if the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, file Form W-8ECI instead.",

The rules for withholding and paying over this amount are similar to the rules for sales of U.S. real property interests. You will receive a Form 8288-A reflecting the amount withheld that you may then claim on line 25f of your Form 1040-NR as a credit against the tax you owe on the gain. You may be able to provide certain information to the transferee to reduce or eliminate withholding. For example, if a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies to all of the gain realized on a transfer, the transferee does not need to withhold if you provide a notice describing the application of a nonrecognition provision. If you are a transferee that failed to withhold, under section 1446(f)(4), the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to you an amount equal to the tax you failed to withhold (plus interest, if applicable). On November 30, 2020, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued final regulations under section 1446(f) in T.D. 9926 (85 FR 76910) for transfers of both non-PTP and PTP interests. The final regulations require any transferee to withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest (other than certain PTP interests) under section 1446(f)(1), unless an exception to withholding applies. These regulations generally apply to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021. However, in accordance with Notice 2021-51, 2021-36 I.R.B. 361, the rules related to withholding under section 1446(f)(4) and to transfers of PTP interests apply to transfers occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, the final regulations revised certain provisions in Regulations section 1.1446-4 for withholding under section 1446(a) on PTP distributions. Also in accordance with Notice 2021-51, these revisions apply to PTP distributions made on or after January 1, 2023. Notices 2018-8 and 2018-29 apply to transfers that occur before the effective date of the final regulations or, as previously described, taxpayers may apply the proposed regulations to transfers of non-PTP interests during this time. For additional guidance on certain issues related to the section 1446(f) regulations, see Notice 2023-8.",

However, if you are not a candidate for a degree and the grant does not meet certain requirements, tax will be withheld at the 30% (or lower treaty) rate.

        "If you work as an employee in the United States, you must pay social security and Medicare taxes in most cases. Your payments of these taxes contribute to your coverage under the U.S. social security system. Social security coverage provides retirement benefits, survivors and disability benefits, and medical insurance (Medicare) benefits to individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. In most cases, the first $168,600 of taxable wages received in 2024 for services performed in the United States is subject to social security tax. All taxable wages are subject to Medicare tax. Your employer deducts these taxes from each wage payment. Your employer must deduct these taxes even if you do not expect to qualify for social security or Medicare benefits. You can claim a credit for excess social security tax on your income tax return if you have more than one employer and the amount deducted from your combined wages for 2024 is more than $10,453.20. If any one employer deducted more than $10,453.20, you cannot claim a credit for that amount. Ask your employer to refund the excess. If your employer does not refund the excess, you can file a claim for refund using Form 843. In general, U.S. social security and Medicare taxes apply to payments of wages for services performed as an employee in the United States, regardless of the citizenship or residence of either the employee or the employer. In limited situations, these taxes apply to wages for services performed outside the United States. Your employer should be able to tell you if social security and Medicare taxes apply to your wages. You cannot make voluntary payments if no taxes are due.",

To establish that your pay is subject only to foreign social security taxes and is exempt from U.S. social security taxes (including the Medicare tax) under an agreement, you or your employer should request a certificate of coverage from the appropriate agency of the foreign country. This will usually be the same agency to which you or your employer pays your foreign social security taxes. The foreign agency will be able to tell you what information is needed for them to issue the certificate.

You don’t have a casualty or theft loss to the extent you are reimbursed. If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, the loss isn’t sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be received. If you expect to be reimbursed for part or all of your loss, you must subtract the expected reimbursement when you figure your loss. You must reduce your loss even if you don’t receive payment until a later tax year. See Reimbursement Received After Deducting Loss, later.",
        "If your property is covered by insurance, you should file a timely insurance claim for reimbursement of your loss. If you don’t file an insurance claim, you can’t deduct the full unrecovered amount as a casualty or theft loss and only the part of the loss that isn’t covered by your insurance policy is deductible. The portion of the loss usually not covered by insurance (for example, a deductible) isn’t subject to this rule.",

        "If you receive excludable cash gifts as a disaster victim and there are no limits on how you can use the money, you don’t reduce your casualty loss by these excludable cash gifts. This applies even if you use the money to pay for repairs to property damaged in the disaster.",
        "You don’t reduce your casualty loss by insurance payments you receive to cover living expenses in either of the following situations. You lose the use of your main home because of a casualty. Government authorities don’t allow you access to your main home because of a casualty or threat of one.",

This section explains the adjustment you may have to make. If you paid amounts to repair damage to a personal residence with a deteriorating concrete foundation and claimed a deduction on an original or amended federal income tax return and payments were made to you (or on your behalf to contractors) by the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company (CFSIC), you must include some or part of the payments in your gross income.

However, if any part of the original deduction didn’t reduce your tax for the earlier year, don’t include that part of the reimbursement amount in your income. You don’t refigure your tax for the year you claimed the deduction. See Recoveries in Pub. 525 to find out how much extra reimbursement to include in income.",

        "There are two ways you can deduct a casualty or theft loss of inventory, including items you hold for sale to customers. One way is to deduct the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold by properly reporting your opening and closing inventories. Don’t claim this loss again as a casualty or theft loss. If you take the loss through the increase in the cost of goods sold, include any insurance or other reimbursement you receive for the loss in gross income. The other way is to deduct the loss separately. If you deduct it separately, eliminate the affected inventory items from the cost of goods sold by making a downward adjustment to opening inventory or purchases. Reduce the loss by the reimbursement you received. Don’t include the reimbursement in gross income. If you don’t receive the reimbursement by the end of the year, you may not claim a loss to the extent you have a reasonable prospect of recovery.",

If you recovered property after you had already taken a theft loss deduction, you must refigure your loss using the smaller of the property’s adjusted basis (explained later) or the decrease in FMV from the time just before it was stolen until the time it was recovered. Use this amount to refigure your total loss for the year in which the loss was deducted. If your refigured loss is less than the loss you deducted, you generally have to report the difference as income in the recovery year. But report the difference only up to the amount of the loss that reduced your tax. For more information on the amount to report, see Recoveries in Pub. 525.",

The repairs are necessary to bring the property back to its condition before the casualty. The amount spent for repairs isn’t excessive. The repairs take care of the damage only. The value of the property after the repairs isn’t, due to the repairs, more than the value of the property before the casualty.",

        "The insurance safe harbor method allows you to figure the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property based upon the estimated loss in reports prepared by your homeowners or flood insurance company. These reports must set forth the estimated loss you sustained from the damage to or the destruction of your property.",
        "If the loss occurred in a disaster area and was due to a federally declared disaster, then you may use the contractor safe harbor method or the disaster loan appraisal method. Under the contractor safe harbor method, you may use the contract price for the repairs specified in a contract prepared by an independent and licensed contractor to determine the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property. This safe harbor method doesn’t apply unless you are subject to a binding contract signed by you and the contractor setting forth the itemized costs to restore your personal-use residential real property to its condition immediately before the casualty.",
        "Under the disaster loan appraisal safe harbor method, you may use an appraisal prepared to obtain a loan of federal funds or a loan guarantee from the federal government that identifies your estimated loss from a federally declared disaster to determine the decrease in the FMV of your personal-use residential real property.",

The amount you spend on insurance or to board up your house against a storm isn’t part of your loss. If the property is business property, these expenses are deductible as business expenses. If you make permanent improvements to your property to protect it against a casualty or theft, add the cost of these improvements to your basis in the property. An example would be the cost of a dike to prevent flooding.",

See Appraisal, earlier, under Figuring Decrease in FMV—Items To Consider for information about appraisals. The costs of photographs and appraisals used as evidence of the value and condition of property damaged as a result of a casualty aren’t a part of the loss. They are expenses in determining your tax liability. For tax years 2018 through 2025, they can no longer be deducted as miscellaneous itemized deductions.",

You must figure each loss separately because the losses attributed to these two uses are figured in two different ways. When figuring each loss, allocate the total cost or basis, the FMV before and after the casualty or theft loss, and the insurance or other reimbursement between the business and personal use of the property.

        "To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions). Your qualifying child must have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions) for you to claim a higher EIC amount based on that child. If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, but that child doesn't have a valid SSN issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you may be eligible to claim a self-only EIC if you are otherwise eligible. For information about how to complete Schedule EIC if your qualifying child or children don't have valid SSNs issued on or before the due date of your return, see Schedule EIC. An SSN is valid for the EIC unless it was issued after the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) or it was issued solely to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit and does not authorize you to work. An example of a federally funded benefit is Medicaid. If you, your spouse, or your child has a social security card with “Not valid for employment” printed on it and the immigration status of you, your spouse, or your child has changed so that the individual is now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a social security card without the legend..",

Full-time work (or part-time work done at an employer's convenience) in a competitive work situation for at least the minimum wage shows that the child can engage in substantial gainful activity. Substantial gainful activity isn't work done to take care of yourself or your home. It isn't unpaid work on hobbies, institutional therapy or training, school attendance, clubs, social programs, and similar activities. However, doing this kind of work may show that the child is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.

To qualify for the exemption, you must be able to demonstrate that you meet the requirements of the international organization agreement or the U.S. tax law.

If the rescinding spouse need not file a return but does file a return (for example, to receive a refund), attach the statement to the return. 3. If the rescinding spouse need not file a return and has not requested a refund, mail the statement to the IRS service center where you filed your last combined return. 2. Death. The death of either spouse will terminate the choice, beginning with the tax year after the spouse's death. However, if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident and is entitled to file as a surviving spouse, the choice will terminate when the last year in which the combined tax rates may be used ends. If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice will terminate on the first day of the tax year after both spouses die. 3. Legal separation. A legal separation under a divorce decree or separation maintenance order will terminate the choice as of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs. 4. Insufficient records. If either spouse fails to keep adequate books, records, or other information necessary to determine the correct amount of income tax liability or to give the IRS adequate access to these records, the IRS may terminate the choice for any tax year.",

You must report these amounts from sources both within and outside the United States.",
        "Non-tax-law residents are taxed only on their income from the U.S. and on certain income related to trade or business in the U.S. (see Chapter 4). The general rules for determining U.S. source income for most non-tax-law residents are discussed in Table 2-1. The following discussion covers the general rules and the exceptions to those rules. Not all items of U.S. source income are taxable. See Chapter 4, Section 3.",

        "Sales of property located in the United States and sales of or located in a foreign country and sales of or located in the United States of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other mineral, or timber products are part of income from the United States. For information on determining the part, see Regulation § 1.863-1(b).",
        "Your tax residence is the overall area of your main business, work or job location, wherever your family home may be. Your tax residence is the place where you permanently or indefinitely work as an employee or self-employed person. If your work nature does not have a fixed or main business location, then your tax residence is the place where you usually live. If you do not fall into either of these two categories, you will be considered as a mobile population, your work location is your tax residence.",
        "Inventory property refers to property that is held for sale or is primarily used in your trade or business and is sold to customers in the normal course of your trade or business. Revenue from the sale of inventory property is derived from the sale of the property. Generally, this is the place where ownership of the property is transferred to the buyer. For example, in the United States, income from the sale of inventory is U.S. source income, whether you purchase the inventory in the United States or abroad. You earn revenue from the sale of inventory property in the country where the property is produced. Even if your tax residence is not in the United States, these rules apply.",
        "If you are to determine the source of any gain from the sale of depreciable personal property, you must first calculate the portion of the gain that is not in excess of the total depreciation adjustment. You will allocate this portion of the gain to the U.S. source by applying the ratio of U.S. depreciation adjustment to total depreciation adjustment. The remainder of the gain will be considered to be from a source other than the U.S. For this purpose, 'U.S. depreciation adjustment item' is depreciation allowed in computing taxable income from property based on depreciation. However, if the property is primarily used in the U.S. during the tax year, all depreciation deductions allowed for that year are treated as U.S. depreciation. However, there are certain exceptions for property used in international transportation, communications, and other activities. As stated above, the source of gain from the sale of depreciable assets is inventory assets. The source of loss is the same as the source of depreciation deduction. However, if the property is primarily used in the U.S., the entire loss will be reduced from U.S. income. The cost basis of property is generally the amount you paid for the property (money plus the fair market value of other property or services). Depreciation is the amount you deduct to recover the cost of trade or business assets or other basis. The amount you can deduct depends on the cost of the property, the time you begin to use the property, the time required to recover the cost, and the depreciation method you use. Depreciation deductions are any deductions for depreciation or amortization, or any other allowed deduction that treats a capital expenditure as a deductible expense. ",
        "Non-tangible property includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets or formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, or other similar property. The proceeds from the sale of depreciable or amortizable non-tangible assets, to the extent of previously allowed depreciation or amortization, are from the same source as the original deduction. This is the same as the rules for the source of income from the sale of depreciable assets. See the section on Depreciable Property in the following text for details on how to apply this rule. If the income from the sale is dependent on the productivity, use, or disposal of the property, then the excess of the depreciation or amortization deduction is from the country where the property is used. If the income is not dependent on the productivity, use, or disposal of the property, then the income is from your tax residence (as discussed in the preceding text). If payments for goodwill are not dependent on its productivity, use, or disposal, then its source is the country where the goodwill is created.",
        "Regardless of any earlier rules, if you do not have a tax home in the United States but have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, income from the sale of any personal property (including inventory) may be attributed to that office or place of business as United States source income. However, if your office or other fixed place of business abroad is substantially involved in the sale, this rule does not apply to the sale of inventory used, disposed of, or consumed abroad. If you have a tax home in the United States but have an office or other fixed place of business abroad, income from the sale of personal property (other than inventory, depreciable property, or intangible assets) may be attributed to a foreign office or place of business as United States source income. If the income paid to a foreign country is less than 10 percent of the selling price, the income will be treated as United States source income. If a foreign country levies a tax on the sale resulting in a gain that is less than 10 percent, this rule also applies to losses.",

Interest on debt issued by a resident or domestic corporation on or before August 10, 2010, that is settled in the tax year of the payor in which the interest is paid, if the interest is at least 80% (0.80) of the total income of the payor in the 3 years before the interest is paid: 1. From sources outside the U.S. and 2. Attributable to a person or corporation that is actively engaged in trade or business in a foreign country or U.S. territory. However, if either of the following is true, the interest will be treated as U.S. source interest income. 1. The recipient of the interest is related to a resident or domestic corporation. See section 954(d)(3) for the definition of related persons. 2. The obligation has been substantially modified after August 9, 2010. Any extension of the obligation is considered a substantial modification. 2. Interest paid on deposit or withdrawal accounts in a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership, if the branch is engaged in commercial banking. 3. Interest on deposits in a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership, if the branch is engaged in commercial banking.",
        "In most cases, dividends received from domestic companies are sourced from the U.S. Foreign company dividends are generally foreign source income. An exception to the second rule is discussed in the text below. In securities lending or sale – repurchase transactions, the source of the alternative dividend paid to the securities lender is the same as the distribution method of the securities being transferred.",
        "If the taxpayer is the counterparty under the contract, the amount of the stock dividend equivalent is any total amount of the stock dividend equivalent referred to in the contract and is used to calculate any net amount transferred to or from the taxpayer under the contract. Therefore, even if the taxpayer made a net payment or did not pay any amount because the net amount was zero, the taxpayer may be considered to have received a stock dividend equivalent payment. For 2023, if the contract is a hedge of one, the designated nominal principal contract or the stock link instrument is usually a designated nominal principal contract or a designated stock link instrument. In general, the hedge value is the fair market value change of the designated nominal principal contract or the stock link instrument divided by the fair market value change of the contract's stock number. In general, the stock dividend equivalent amount for a specific designated nominal principal contract or a specific stock link instrument is the stock dividend amount per share multiplied by the contract's stock number multiplied by the contract's hedge value. Complex contracts are subject to special rules. For more information, see Section 1.871-15 of the regulations and Notice 2020-03.",

Wages (except for certain additional benefits) are time-based. Certain additional benefits (such as housing and education) are region-based. Alternatively, you may be allowed to use an alternative basis to determine the source of compensation. See the text below for more information on alternative bases.",
        "Specific companies sell products through multi-level marketing arrangements, for example, by sponsoring lower-level resellers, the upper-level resellers are entitled to receive payments from the company based on the specific activities of the lower-level resellers. Generally, these multi-level marketing companies pay the independent (non-employee) resellers (upper-level resellers) based on the sales or purchases made by the resellers they sponsor, which constitutes income for providing personal services to recruit, train and assist lower-level resellers. The source of this income is usually based on the location where the upper-level resellers provide services, and may be considered as multi-year salary income depending on the facts and circumstances. The income source is determined based on the period of time for which the services are provided as multi-year salary income.",
        "If you are self-employed, you determine the source of self-employment or personal service income based on the facts and circumstances of your particular situation, in order to most accurately reflect the source of the income. In many cases, the facts and circumstances require an allocation by time, as described below.",
        "The source of your annual salary is generally determined by the time base on which the salary is attributed. Annual salary is the amount of salary included in your income for a tax year that is attributed to a period of time that includes 2 or more tax years. You determine the period of time for which the salary is paid based on the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, the amount of salary attributed to a period of time that spans multiple calendar years is attributed to the entire years. The amount of salary from the United States is calculated by multiplying the total amount of annual salary by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or less than a day unit, such as a partial day) you worked or provided personal services for the case in the United States. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of days (or less than a day unit, if appropriate) you worked or provided personal services for the case.",
        "In addition to tax allowances and danger or hardship allowances, the above additional benefits are based on your main place of work as the source. Your main place of work is usually the place where you spend most of your working time. This can be your office, factory, store, outlet or other location. If you spend most of your working time in more than one place, your main place of work is the central place where you report for work or where the work content is based. If you have more than one job at any time, your main place of work is determined by the facts of each situation. The more important factors to consider are: the total time you spend at each place, the amount of work you do at each place, and how much you earn at each place.",

Actual expenses do not include the cost of any vehicle purchased by you or on your behalf (including interest).",
        "The source of compensation for moving expenses is usually determined by the location of your new principal place of work. However, if you provide sufficient evidence to show that the source is more appropriate based on the facts and circumstances of your case, the source will be determined by the location of your former principal place of work. Sufficient evidence usually requires a written statement from you and your employer, or a written statement from the company that was simplified into written form before the move and was established to encourage you or other employees to move to another country. The written statement or agreement must state that your employer will compensate you for moving expenses incurred before returning to your former principal place of work, whether you continue to work for your employer after returning to that location. It may include specific conditions for determining your right to compensation, provided that the standards for satisfying those conditions are clearly determinable and can only be satisfied before you return to your former principal place of work or after you have completed the move.",

Such other qualifying entity's any class of stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, or 2. Such other qualifying entity is a regulated investment company issuing specific redeemable securities.

In addition, you must meet the extra requirements for workers who do not have qualifying children, or your children must meet all the requirements for qualifying children. The low-income family benefit will reduce the amount of tax you owe and may give you a refund. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/EIC. If you (and your spouse, if you file a joint return) did not get a Social Security number by the due date of your 2023 return (including an extended due date), you cannot claim the low-income family benefit on your original or amended 2023 return. In addition, if a child did not get a Social Security number by the due date of your return (including an extended due date), you cannot include that child as a qualifying child when you calculate the low-income family benefit on your original or amended 2023 return. If the Social Security card has a stamp that says «Not Valid for Employment» and the number was issued for you (or your spouse or your qualifying child) to get federal assistance, you cannot claim the low-income family benefit. Federal assistance benefits include Medicaid. If the card has this stamp and the person's immigration status has changed so that the person is now a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, ask the Social Security Administration to issue a new Social Security card without the stamp. To see if you qualify for the low-income family benefit, go to IRS.gov/EITCAssistant. ",

For personal service income discussed below, submit form 8233. If you are eligible for exemption under the treaty but did not submit form 8233 to your withholding agent to apply for withholding exemption, you can still claim the exemption by filing form 1040-NR.

Depending on the calendar year in which the U.S. total income is earned, you can apply for withholding tax exemption using Form 13930. Even if a tax treaty provides that the income is exempt from tax, withholding tax may still be required.

        "If you are an employee working in the United States, in most cases, you must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. Your Social Security tax payments will go toward your Social Security insurance contributions. Social Security insurance provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits, as well as Medicare health insurance benefits, to individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. In most cases, you must pay Social Security tax on the first $160,200 of your 2023 income earned in the United States. All taxable income must also be subject to Medicare tax. Your employer will deduct these taxes from each of your paychecks. Even if you do not expect to qualify for Social Security or Medicare benefits, your employer must still deduct these taxes. If you have multiple employers and your total Social Security taxes deducted from your 2023 income exceed $9,932.40, you can claim a tax credit for excess Social Security taxes on your income tax return. If any one employer deducts more than $9,932.40, you cannot claim a credit for that amount. Ask your employer to refund the excess. If your employer does not refund the excess, you can file a refund claim using Form 843. Generally, Social Security and Medicare taxes apply to wages earned as an employee in the United States, regardless of the citizenship or residence of the employee or employer. In limited circumstances, these taxes may apply to wages earned outside the United States. Your employer should be able to tell you whether Social Security and Medicare taxes apply to your wages.

This is usually the same agency to which you or your employer pay the foreign social security tax. The foreign agency will be able to tell you what information they need to issue the certificate.

        "Due to changes in the law, the IRS cannot issue tax returns with the correct EITC or ACTC amounts before mid-February 2018. This applies to the entire refund amount, not just the amount of the benefit.",
        "請前往 IRS.gov/Tools 來使用這些工具。 低收入家庭福利優惠 （IRS.gov/EIC） 判定您是否符合低收入家庭福利優惠。 僱主識別號碼申請 （IRS.gov/EIN） 幫助您獲取僱主識別號碼。 IRS 預扣稅金估算表 （IRS.gov/W4App） 會估算您應針對聯邦所得稅從薪水中預扣的金額。 首次購房者抵免額帳戶查詢 （英文） （IRS.gov/HomeBuyer （英文）） 工具為您的還款和帳戶餘額提供資訊。 銷售稅扣除額計算器 （英文） （IRS.gov/SalesTax） 計算如果您在附件 A（《表格 1040》）中逐項列出扣除額、選擇不申領州和地方所得稅，並且您沒有保留顯示您支付的銷售稅的收據，您可以申領的金額。",
